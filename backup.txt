new:
and update perhaps 15 years later...
using mostly an iPad mini 2 / iOS...

Dropbox
  - main source
  - backups folder
    - backup of web server
    - screenshot of apps
Google Drive
  - backup of Dropbox, encrypted with Dropbox password
  - on iOS, must use IFTTT (or another service)
    - must be careful and delete access / permissions immediately afterwards
iCloud
  - backup of iOS devices
    - includes: settings, contacts, photos (currently on the devices), music (currently on the devices), etc.
      - Voice Dream Reader is probably the largest and most important thing to backup
      - all writing applications (text and markdown writers) might have some text files saved under the Apps folder (on the iOS device)
        - should avoid using this, and put everything into Dropbox, but, when offline, maybe tough to do
      - game saves
      - GarageBand songs and other making apps
