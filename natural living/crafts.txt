# natural paint
  - pigment: charcoal (black), berries (red to blue range), etc.
  - oil: linseed
  - extra?

tip: use plastic (bag, glove, etc.) to smear the paint easily over any part, especially for things like motorcycles.

anti-industry awareness: most paints are synthetic, meaning, any color seen on any building is likely synthetically made, with chemicals


# hunting and gathering
the best. Knowledge is power here. Learn to identify plants in the area you live in. Save the locations of places with certain plants. For example: where huge amount of water spinach is, or dragon hair vegetable, or some wild fruits.

## farms
can also pick bits from nearby farms. Perhaps better to ask if consistently harvesting from the same area.

## independent farmers
pay homage to these great people, and buy all of their food!


# gardening / planting
## hydroponics
great for small areas. Clean. Limited to leafy vegetables, and other shallow-rooted plants? Root vegetables are impossible?

## container gardening
good for small areas, but still requires water drainage, a space outside for rainwater to supply water, and the mess of soil, insects, etc.

## gardening (on land)
can grow anything, but requires more maintenance, competing with other plants, and especially against pests, including larger animals.

## guerrilla gardening (on another’s land)
hmmm…

## compost
Cover on sunny days to keep damp? Cover on rainy days (with holes) to limit amount of water? Flip compost periodically (time?)?
