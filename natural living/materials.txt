natural:

metals:
  - titanium
    - lighter than stainless steel
    - safe for food
    - [todo: probably better in other ways]
    - expensive
  - steel
    - stainless steel
      - safe for food (and drinks)
      - does not rust
    - high carbon steel
      - sharper than stainless steel, so used for blades, but easier to corrode? Or at least, must clean after every use
   - aluminum
     - does not rust. Corrodes, but very difficult to corrode.
     - lightweight
     - why not use this for travel goods?
     - i think the lightweight steel-appearing bottles are aluminum
   - 白鐵 [todo: forgot English name, some coated iron, maybe “tinplate”?]
    - doesn’t rust due to some kind of coating, but can probably cut the coating?
   - iron
     - rusts, cheap (for large applications)


fabrics:
  - cotton
  - silk
  - polyester (todo: synthetic? difficult to recycle?)
    - usually blended with cotton
    - permeable
  - nylon
    - waterproof?
  - twine
  - hemp

woods:
  - wood
    - decays over time without protective care
  - bamboo
    - nearly waterproof when dried
    - used wherever it's pole shape fits
  - rattan
    - waterproof? Just becomes more malleable when soaked in water
    - used for weaving outdoor furniture
  - 

synthetic:
carbon fiber
  - super lightweight solid
  - used to replace metals where weight is important (camping equipment, sports equipment)
  - expensive
cuben fiber
  - a super lightweight fabric, waterproof, difficult to abrase and maybe even tear
  - can add heavy nylon to make it more impervious to tearing
  - used in "ultra-light" camping equipment
  - expensive

plastics:
  - todo: read wiki page for the huge list of different kinds of plastics
  - PP
    - Tritan (a brand-name) used from some water bottles
  - thermoplastics:
    - ABS - human-safe, can cast into any shape, used everywhere from toys to helmets, used in 3D-printing
    - PLA - biodegradable, but might use petroleum to run the machines to make stuff anyway
