my philosophy:
  - Maintain a foreigner point of view, a non-cultured view
  - Language is a part of culture, but artificial, and never enough to display meaning
  - It’s up to the viewer to create judgement, thoughts, etc.
  - Relationships are an adventure. Do not abandon them!
  - Make everyday an adventure, resulting in constant novelty
  - Consume culture and move on? It’s fascinating not on it’s own, but how things came to people, why people follow it, how it develops, but after one learns those things, getting accustomed to it is dull.
  - Treat people as people! Not just some media or novelty
  - Live in public
  - Work in air conditioned environment, but go out in the heat to socialize

  - Why did I give up on social life? Why do I always? SPD? Or do I just consume knowledge and continue to explore?

  - Culture is also a fascinating part of films, especially to think how it develops

Live without planning. Live and work, as I did in Seoul?

  - BE CREATIVE ALL OF THE TIME
  - Chungking Express was made in two months
  - THINK BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
    - watch out for conspicuous consumption and hedonism
  - DON'T LOWER YOUR FUCKING STANDARD. DON'T LOWER YOUR FUCKING STANDARD.
    - yet be able to associate yourself with the world for social health
  - Work does not out-prioritize life
  - Wake up because you want to live, not because you want to work
  - LIMIT WORK TO GRAND WORK and HIGH MONEY RATIO WORK ($2000/two weeks)
    - Banksy art, political movements
  - MAKE EVERYDAY AN ADVENTURE
  - Do as much as you can in an hour, yet when don't have something you want to do, remember, that it is okay to do nothing: sit, think, write, wander. Don't become anxious or angry at the passing time.
  - Constantly manage time. Balance life, work, and social time
  - Your narrowness in direction is destroying your life. You have to live normally at any time and place, create new directions. When you went home, after living in a city, all you ould think about was the work you had planned to do -- making games and planning the next move --, but you forgot to live a normal daily life with the people around you. You have to live, be open, allow plans to change. I gauged my progress based on initial goals. If I were open, I could have spent time with my family and friends, met people, picked up a gig, and still get the same amount of work done or even greater, because I am not forcing myself to work.
  - Don't force yourself to work, just living by feeling. That's how it should be. Don't worry about what to do, it will come while in time while living.
  - Don't immediately work in the morning. Go somewhere. Travel. Live.
  - On time perception: The perception of another persons' emotions can also change our sense of time.
    - The feeling of awe has the ability to expand one's perceptions of time availability.
    - Emotions may speed up or slow down our perception of time.
    - Disorders linked to abnormalities in dopamine levels in the brain as well as to noticeable impairments in time perception.
  - Think at Peter Pan’s speed?
  - Don’t rely on programming as a source of income, stray away
  - Stay nomadic?
  - Keep belongings at a minimal amount
  - Everyday life, no fine art. Avoid Upper class areas. Live with the working class. India, Kathmandu, orphans, etc
  - As long as people are awake, spend time with people, not media. time flies when you are alone.

  - talk to people about work everyday, to keep yourself in your own path and to stay social, meeting people, taking on projects, don’t stop
  - Build relationships to create a studio with close friends.
  - Call, don’t use lesser methods of communication. Keep in contact with people via calls or at the worse, voice messages via WeChat.
  - Don’t be secretive in grandeur, talk about it, like Peter, Ian, Syed, Kunal, and every smart person.
  - Maintain a foreigner point of view, a non-cultured view
  - Language is a part of culture, but artificial, and never enough to display meaning
  - It’s up to the viewer to create judgement, thoughts, etc.
  - Relationships are an adventure. Do not abandon them!
  - Make everyday an adventure, resulting in constant novelty
  - Consume culture and move on? It’s fascinating not on it’s own, but how things came to people, why people follow it, how it develops, but after one learns those things, getting accustomed to it is dull.
  - Treat people as people! Not just some media or novelty
  - Live in public
  - Work in air conditioned environment, but go out in the heat to socialize and be creative
  - when constantly creating: traveling


Once per day (in order of time of day):
- Wake Up
  - depends whether if intrinsic motivation involves other people, and therefore other people’s time
  - it helps to sleep with people in the same room
  - also keep sunlight and light therapy in mind
- Travel
  - try to keep the amount of time spent at home in the morning minimal. Go as soon as possible. Don't think about what to do until you are outside.
  - this is needed first to avoid thinking and consuming inside the house, which can be depressing, as opposed to thinking while traveling, which is grand
  - could use media if travel is not possible. It might inspire one to get out if under deep depression.
  - wander around. Try a new area. Spend time with people in old areas.
  - or just walk around the neighborhood. Say hello to the people you live with and the people around
  - travel until you feel free. Until you feel like working.
Think
  - think all of the time
  - life, high level, reflect the past and present, is everything going right, what's wrong? Fix it.
  - hike to a park, or a similar crowded outdoor social place
- Design
  - During the day.
- Implement design / work
  - Design and work go together. Don't do something without thinking about it.
  - At night. Or set times in workplaces, away from distraction (public parks, cafes, trains, buses, etc.)
- Entertainment / Art / Travel
  - limit to great ones, Cannes film festival films, Babycastles curated games, concise short stories and poems, innovative graphic novels
  - priority to travel to avoid using references in design
  - if work involves computers, take a walk outside, talk, eat with people (all kinds), instead of using media
- Social
  - surround yourself with smart people. If not, interact with them via the internet.
  - talk to local people too, don't be a fine art snob
- Family
  - post a picture of my life once a day
- Friends
- Language Practice
  - 'cause your brain can always fit more every day
  - TV shows, talk to people, talk to native friends, use an online language exchange service

Every Weekend:
art jam

Timed  (looking back, this seems outdated. Don't have a routine. Constantly think and do without a plan):
  - wake up, drink water or eat and drink milk, poop, shower, brush
  - go out
  - think
  - work
  - exercise break and eat protein
  - think
  - work
  - exercise
  - social / volunteer
  - drone work

Make sure your mind and body are healthy:
- Be self-aware. Are you as productive as you were during you best production times? If not, step back, watch a movie, exercise, work in a different area, sit upright, take a 5 minute break, take a shower (especially when experienced heat), take a blank sheet of paper or a new page in a composition book to think and design next steps
- Are you currently unmotivated? Don't force yourself to work. Think. Take your time.
- Suffering from indecision on what to do next? I haven't figured out how to solve this really. Just don't take too long. Go on impulse. Do what you can right now.
- Don't waste time on inferior media
- Don't wander around the city without direction

Balance work and life:
  - You have to live and work.
    - Work is based on a moment of life.
    - Everything is based on the moment. It's what you think about. What you're surrounded by. What you're doing.
    - Avoid doing one or the other. Work with people. Work while exploring. Work in the public. Never hole yourself in your own room or a library. You have to keep living. No computers. Stay outside. Work in a park, a public shared space, with friends and family.

Time Management:
  - Life is about managing time. Time with family, friends, work, design. Always think about where you are allocating time before doing anything, like a business man.

Media:
  - need sounds for stimulation?
  - Consume something that no one else consumes.
  - Consume life, not media.
  - If it is media, consume world music, sounds, surround yourself in a different place.
  - If you are traveling, consume locally

Money:
Do not worry about money (treat it as a sign of insecurity):
- I can make $60,000+/year with a programming job and I can live off of $15,000/year in a large city and $2,000/year in India
- Only focus on making stuff
- Do not lower your standards for the sake of money
- Can make good money doing simple jobs — cafe, librarian, communications, post office, etc.

Live simply:
- Avoid conpsicuous consumption
  - Consumption of intellectually stimulating material is not a factor of creativity, although it is a good form of leisure
- Avoid purchasing from large companies and buy local (large companies are far more convenient though)
- Money is not a factor of leisure
- Location is not a factor of living simply, it just requires more willpower in areas with more bad influences

Art:
- Make sure your goal is to do something no one else has. It must be ambitious. Make something great.
- Go from project to project and stay busy
  - for film, go out, find a subject, ask to shoot, shoot, edit, publish
  - for digital, write idea, prototype, playtest, complete, publish
- Take time to design. Is the design as great as the greatest? If not, don't spend time implementing it. Work without great design is wasted time.

Avoid traps:
- Don't plan far ahead. Live for the moment. Just have a few end goals.
- Don't document the past, move forward. But do take time to think about how to improve over past errors.
- Don't choose to do something because it is easy
- Bad peer influence. Avoid spending time with the wrong people, unless there is a reason. You should always feel as if you are learning something. You should be able to lead others by improving their lifestyle, while living your own way.
- Don't do something because it's in front of you. Choose your own direction.
- If you wake up later than 10:30AM, then it's possible you are missing a reason to wake up. Find a responsibility. Don't live alone. Also may be the onset of depression.
- If you decide not to do a task because you are too lazy, it may mean the onset of depression. If it is at night, then it maybe be better to just sleep. Wake up early enough and do the tasks. Don't take the easy route.
- Do not base life on todo lists. Just live. Don't write everything down.
- Do not choose a direction in which you live in a house alone. Choose a direction in which you are forced to interact with people daily.
- When you feel like consuming something, just go out, wander, travel, don't worry about direction.
- Don't stay in a room alone. If you must, use media to aid you through.
- Only use the computer for work. Not media. Not Facebook. Not a replacement for life.
- Don't stay up late using the computer
- Don't wander around with heavy bags
- Don't stop communicating to people. Keep it short if you don't want to talk to people, but do respond.
- Don’t consume indie art, consume local social life, wander around

decision making fallacies:
- sunk costs
  - should ignore them when making a decision, because they cannot be changed
  - dilemma (programming contracts)
    - proper foresight (and constant communication)

other:
Rent or buy very cheap apartments to lessen the money deadline feel, like Jon, live in traditional areas, enjoy the long commute, cook traditional food, look forward to going home

Reference:

Criteria for creating a good work environment:
Own room / space, public quiet working space (library, cafe), if computer: stable and fast wi-fi, if heavy CPU use: electrical socket, bathroom, water, snacks (nuts), exercise space, refridgerator, grocery store

Tips for hot areas:
  - Take a shower in the morning and evening. It hydrates the body, leaving you mosquito-proof.
  - Don't carry a heavy backpack in the heat. It will make you hungry and thirsty.
