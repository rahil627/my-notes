general

I believe 2 per mineral patch is saturation... That's the limit you absolutely don't want to excede.
You start losing efficiency very quickly at 1.5 per mineral patch though, so when you get between 1.5 and 2 it's good to seek out an expansion and maynard.
You should only force up to 2/mineral patch when you're contained and/or are preparing at least one expand you can maynard to. 

hotkeys
assign f2/f3/f4 to town centers - for building, saving workers against drops
control groups
waypoints
queuing

4 workers on gas
probe vs drone - first hit wins, dunno about SUV
"cut corners" - be minimalistic in spending on defense, use saved money on economy

Jaedong is all economy micro, except mutas

kill tech buildings
10 scout
economy game - everything is based on defending/attacking the economy

general tricks
make a group of probes target one mineral then attack zelot (watch out for manner pylon)
lure enemy into doing something, then attack. like let a shuttle come in, then attack it. show some weakness, then attack.

Protoss
12/15 gateways - for goons
archon forming can tank?
cannons near base or defense
always have 1 base more than terran
in the midst of a late battle, send dark templars to the enemies bases

cannon/tech
corsair/reaver
manner pylon - probe builds pylon blocking minerals, and zelot kills a worker
storm drop
zelot/archon

reaver defense - build pylons near entrance

vs zerg
scout zerg early
always scout - keep probe alive until corsair
+1 weapon (over zerg armor) zelot will kill zerglings in two hits, instead of 3. 4 hits for 0 weapon zelot vs 3 armor zergling
corsair to kill overlords
feedback defilers
bisu build - corsair/dt
pylon block zerg's natural
defense - gateway/forge/pylon and 2 cannons behind
try to tech, with the least amount of defense, but be sure to scout for early attacks

vs terran
12 nexus
end game techs - arbiter stasis/high templer
need storms mid-game
zelot bomb - shuttle zelots over tanks (probe bomb variation?)
carriers - any map with ridges (katrina/loki)
pylons block all mech (including vultures!)

tricks/facts
if you press stop on a reaver, which has a scarab on the field, the scarab will explode dealing no damage
storms do not stack

use mutalisks to tank goliaths, and send in zergling and/or hydras to kill

tricks
larva bug - group overlord and larva, then press S
morph injured mutalisks
drone regenerate hp - build extracter and cancel it
stop lurker trap

Macro is the name of all the actions during a strategy game relating to the mindset of the player, the economy of the match, and the overall strategy that a player has.
Micro, on the other hand, relates to the small details within a game, such as selecting units, deselecting units, giving a group of units actions to move and attack, using abilities etc.
m&m's - marines and medics

math
some upgrades are counted twice.
Firebat (3 attacks) (upgrades add +1 in 2 out of the 3 shots, so +2)
Zealot (2 attacks)
Goliath air (2 attacks) (upgrade adds +2 in both shoots, so +4)
Scout air (2 attacks)
Wraith (2 attacks) I will go against everyone else and say its 2. =p

Others:
Valkyrie (8 attacks) (Only the power of a single shot appears in the pop up box)
Carrier (1-8 Attacks) (Only the power of a single shot appears in the pop up box)
Getting plus 1 attack for these units is often quite beneficial for the offender, and +1 defense good for the defender.

Special:
Mutalisk (1-3 hits) (shot 1: base damage, Shot 2: base damage/3, Shot 3: base damage/9)

(base damage - armor*number of attacks) / (attack type armor type relations)
explosive : 100% large 75% medium 50% small
normal : 100% all
concusive (vulture/ghost/firebat) - 100%small 50% medium 25% large

If you read the thread Chill quoted, it is stated there that armor is deducted from damage before any size/weapon calculations. So, +1 golies do 2x12 damage, with +1 carapace, that becomes 2x11 damage or 11 damage after armor type reduction (to be perfectly precise, 2x5,5 damage, and yes, fractional damage is possible). Air carapace doesn't cancel goliath damage, in fact, no upgrade can make anything more durable vs something due to these mechanics, the best you can hope for is parity (zealot vs zergling, all upgrades cancel each other), usually it's either reduced effect (if the weapon upgrade adds at least +2 per hit, for example, dragoon or goliath air attack) or even completely neglible (any kind of upgrading vs tanks or reavers, since the difference between 99 damage and 100 damage is hardly important).



***1***
1. Reduction from splash zone(damage is multiplied by 0.25/0.5/1.0)
2. Armor amount reduction
3. Armor type reduction
If it's a protoss unit and:
a) Currently has no shields, just the armor type and amount of the unit are used.
b) It has shields, the shield upgrade amount is used and the armor type takes 100% from everything. If this attack depletes the shields, the leftover damage after depleting the shields is calculated again as in case a)

The minimum damage from an attack is 0.5 and this does not apply twice for the separate shield/hp calculations for protoss units.

Damage amount is rounded to 1/256.

***2*** Units with "special" attacks:
Zealot - 2 attacks by 8 + 1 per upgrade
Scout Air - 2 attacks by 14 + 1 per upgrade
Goliath Air - 2 attacks by 10 + 2 per upgrade
Firebat - 3 attacks by 8 + 1 per upgrade, even burrowed lurkers can be hit by all 3 attacks, it just depends on the angle of attack(the amount shoed is hardcoded to be the damage of 2 of the attacks added up, but all three are upgraded and each deals 8 damage base)
Lurker - several attacks by 20 + 2 per upgrade, with the restriction that only 1 attack can hit a single unit and all of them have only 100% splash(the 50% and 25% areas are the same as the 100%, so a unit can't take partial damage from the lurker's attack). A bug can override this rule, this happens when the lurker dies the exact moment it attacks, then a unit can be hit by several of the attacks, it's easily noticable with full hp marines dying to a single lurker.
Valk - 8 attacks by 6 + 1 per upgrade, if there are multiple units in the 100% splash zone, only one will take 100% damage and the others will take 50%. The same aplies to corsairs.
Mutalisk bounces deal 1/3 less than the previous bounce, for example +1 damage muta against 3 targets with 1 armor will deal 10 - 1 = 9 on the first hit, 10 / 3 - 1 = 2.333...(rounded to the nearest 1/256) on the second hit and 10 / 9 - 1 = 0.111... upped to 0.5, which is the minimum damage, on the third hit.
Devourer spores increase damage from each attack by 1 per spore, this includes spell damage.
Not an unit attack, but since it affects attacks: Defensive matrix reduces attack damage to the minimum - 0.5, this includes spell damage. The total damage prevented is 250, but this does not acount the minimum damage inflicted or the unit's armor, so a zergling with 5 damage will perish the shield in 50 hits and still deal 25 damage, no matter the target's armor and the end effect will be 225 damage absorbed on a unit with 0 armor and even less on a unit with several points of armor(if the target has 5 armor, for example, the Defensive Matrix will NOT make any difference).
An exception to these 2 is the plague, which doesn't deal damage, but directly removes hp, so it doesn't interact with defensive matrix or acid spores(even if you change plague's attack type in the .dat files it doesn't change the spell's effect at all).

Nukes deal:
Against units/buildings with 750 or less total maximum HP + shields -> 500, 250, 125 explosive damage. 
Against units/buildings with 750 or more total maximum HP + shields ->
2/3, 1/3, 1/6 of the total maximum HP + shields.
The three values are for the 100%, 50% and 25% splash zones ofc.

***3*** Burrowed units and Dark Swarm mechanics
Burrowed units take only 100% damage splash. If they are in the 25% or 50% zone they will take no damage at all. You can test it even with a nuke - burrowed units near the end of the damage zone will take no damage at all, while unburrowed will.

Dark Swarm makes range units attack infront of the target, so units with no splash attack don't hit their target at all. 

Reaver's scarab is a melee unit, so it doesn't effect it(Something interesting - if you press stop on a reaver, which has a scarab on the field, the scarab will explode dealing no damage).
Firebats deal most of their damage with their 100% splash, so they deal damage to burrowed units under swarm, they also deal line splash and fire exactly at the target, not infront of it.
Lurkers also can't really fire infront of their target, so they always hit and they deal all of their damage in 100% splash. 
Tanks won't hit a burrowed lurker thay are aiming at, because the 100% damage zone does not reach the target(the radii on their 100% splash is 10, they normally hit a bit infront of their target and Dark Swarm makes them hit even more off)
High Archons as Siege Tanks can't hit the burrowed unit they are aiming at(under swarm), their 100% damage splash zone has a radii of 3 and they attack infront of their target, if they are too close to it, the actuall attack sprite will appear behind the archon or on top of it.
