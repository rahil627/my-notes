spellbreaker build

You will never reach a high enough OA/DA for legendary using dex alone.
It will require help from items or skills.
So those will define how much dex you need.

Personally I'd aim for 350-400 dex on any melee character.
Higher if it's a spear user (430 or so).

Oh and 1000 OA and DA is just ok-ish in late legendary.
It's enough to avoid most (but not all) criticals and to make sure your offense isn't completely crippled.
But make no mistake , having 1300 or 1500 of each makes a HUGE difference.

Of course you can get a similar (or even better) result by other methods , but most of them require pretty special gear.
