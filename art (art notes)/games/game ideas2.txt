
during that talk by Jonathan Blow about games for education...:

**I was thinking that MMOs impart the most knowledge because it’s a real social experience: a real experience. That’s reality!** Things can be learned by the behavior of others’ actions, of people.

I was also thinking of the Animal Crossing-like or Stardew Valley single-player CPU world, where one could learn by interacting with characters.
  - 1. Having a way to get money, build technology, buy the poorer’s lands, etc. Imparting my own philosophies of the world (money, enclosures, capitalist development / productivity).
    - this is more about the state of the world, civilization, as opposed to an ideal way of living
    - **One Life does this *and* is an MMO! It’s as real as reality gets! It’s civilization, the MMO!!!**

  - 2. Having a native character, a farmer character, a civilized character, etc. The interactions between those people, the differences between people, between cultures. A very JRPG-esque experience, leading the player to have better moral values—vegan, DIY, respect others’ cultures, etc. The games systems force you to have a good moral value. The ecology begins to fail if you over-produce; **Characters become unhappy if you do not share.** **Characters start to fight or die if you don’t take care of others.** **Characters don’t forget your immoral actions.** **Characters judge you, behave differently, depending on how you live.**
    - basically it reinforces good human values, motherly values (which somehow, are missing in the real world...)
  - this could even be done within a small community, without introducing money to the game, making it more of raising a good child (the player)
  - instead of several characters, **it could be a single character, androgynous, that has these motherly / female values. Her dialog depends on your day-to-day actions.** You don’t know how she lives. It’s a mystery. You just have to live / play correctly, in order to get closer to her. She can *feel* that when you kill an animal or tree, the world, the tiny world suffers. She’s basically a moral god, who you can consult, but she doesn’t directly teach you anything...
    - Or maybe she just lives the ideal life, and you must watch her to learn how to live? Otherwise, you’ll destroy the world. The only way to get her to talk is by living right, but, she still won’t love you. She will only be agreeable with you.

  - 3. A multi-player Stardew Valley / Animal Crossing game, where you hang out with your friends, talk, enjoy the world, play. More so focused on scenery, seasons, time passing, as to allow the players to contemplate. Scenic views everywhere, as to provoke memories of places one has been to. Fictional scenic views, to create memories of places where one hasn’t been. The world’s natural hide-outs in a game. (Proteus proved this to work with just single-player)
    - perhaps the players start their day together from home, then wander out. Or, perhaps everyone has their own home, and goes out to hang with whom they like?...
  - **basically: just Stardew Valley, but multi-player, without any goals, money, or anything. You can play around, interact, but there’s no use of collecting anything, storing anything. It’s just play. The world is there to simply play with.** You pitch your tent wherever you want to sleep, or, sleep out-side. You eat a few meals. That’s all. Just do what’s necessary to survive, which isn’t hard, then, spend the rest of the time talking, exploring, playing.
