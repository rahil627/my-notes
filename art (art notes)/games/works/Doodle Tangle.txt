design:

implementation:
  - requirements:
  - handle multi-touch
  - camera
  - collide with bezier curves
    - or a certain color pixel
    - or edge physics collision detection

use MS Paint to create levels
the large image is then cut into tiles
  - the tiles don't have to be too small, but it does help performance
  - the amount of different tiles may be a problem for memory
    - could use a fluid tile set and build with that
the tiles on screen (camera) are active and checked for collision


things needed:
camera
pixel perfect collision detection (simple, between player and map)
  - players only need to check collision for 4 or 9 tiles around them
  - could even check the current (last?) screen's pixels around the player*
path finding (for the camera)

todo:
setup on current iOS
playtest
add sounds
add animation
make compatible for iPad series
release
update
can re-implement in HaxePunk later

ask to use music, free game, or edit
