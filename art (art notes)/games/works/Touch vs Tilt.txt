todo:
  - get design from notes on mac and my design book
  - if using HaxePunk, need to use nme to get accelometer data
    - test it
    - write a helper class for HaxePunk?

from agenda 5/31:
requires camera, tilemap, like Doodle Tangle
tilting moves physics objects
  - should the tilter control a ball that is physics based!?
    - nah, boring
based on touch and tilt
choose simple theme / color pallette, yellow/blue?
can release without art

Gameplay:
One player holds the iPad, tilting (and rotating?) it to direct a path for the other players to follow. The other players keep a touchpoint on the iPad, trying to stay on the generated path.

Origin:
Thinking about using iPad inputs. Possibly influenced by Mime and Doodle Tangle.

Design:
The iPad player tilts (or rotates?) to alter the direction of the road being generated. Maybe tilting up/down changes velocity. Or maybe the game is in 3D and rotating alters direction, tilting up/down changes the elevation of the path, tilting left/right twists the path.

This idea is too similar to Roadeo, but it's the interface that makes the difference!

Touch and Tilt, cooperative mode,

Touch vs Tilt, versus mode,

Implementation:
I'm unsure if an iPad can detect rotation. If not, tilting is enough.

If both rotation and tilting is possible, then 3D could be cool, in which Unity is needed. Although MonoGame does support 3D.
