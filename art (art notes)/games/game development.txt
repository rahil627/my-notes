game development philosophy:
ipad game -> prototype -> playtest -> kickstarter -> create

Be playful, prototype, playtest, and release quickly

Remember to use people's code as a resource: GitHub, BitBucket, Ludum Dare, and other game competitions. Just search the engine, then what you want to do.

TAKE YOUR TIME. DESIGN IT. DESIGN FIRST THEN BEGIN PROGRAMMING. DESIGN INSPIRES PROGRAMMING.

be more expiremental, expirement with feelings, try to capture the slow pace of films





Prototyping also includes playtesting. Does the game work do what it was intended to do? That's the main question.

MAKE A GAME TO EXPRESS FEELINGS. Ask yourself, "is the experience of playing the game meaningful? Did it move me?". If it can't do that, then it's not worth making.

playtesting
have a few advisors that share a somewhat similar vision or taste with you.

ask newbies the following questions and ignore any of their other advice
what did you like?
what didn't you like?
what confused you?

appropriate the qualities of cultural pastimes: easy to learn, spread through word-of-mouth, and possessing organically evolving rules sets defined by those playing.

think of a game idea first
make a complete paper prototype, then begin programming
then choose your programming language / game engine / physics engine

  - game making from a flash developer

see ludam dare game source code

1. Use Flash to start making games immediately.
2. Use C# to make more advanced games and learn more advanced programming.

enter game contests to at least start programming
then think of game concepts, with the mechanic first

small indie game competitions and jams:
compos?, http://gdc.randati.net/ - a timeline of all of them
experimental gameplay project - one theme per month
ludum dare - one theme, short time
global game jam - once a year, largest game jam
game prototype challenge - two themes mixed

more on engines:
Use FlashPunk with AIR?
- FlashPunk (and likely Flixel) don't perform well on iOS becuase they use bitmap.copyPixels
- display-list rendering is faster (and likely optimized by AIR)
- source: http://flashpunk.net/forums/index.php?topic=3866.0

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9272797/framework-for-game-development-on-adobes-air-mobile

https://github.com/ericjohnson/canabalt-ios/tree/master/flixel-ios - Flixel port for iOS, not updated as much 

game engines:
unity - 3d, now 2d open source, free, costs $400 to publish to iOS or Android, great IDE
openframeworks - like processing, except in C++, seems like the best C++ framework
monogame - C#, open source (OpenGL) version of xna, ports to anything, based off of XNA, OpenGL, lacks drawing primitives
x/xna - C#, limited to Windows and Xbox 360
flash - 2d (some 3d), ActionScript, FlashDevelop, FlashPunk, perfect for 2d, relies on Adobe AIR to port mobile 
APIs, not bad, may limitperformance
sdl - C++, world of goo, crayon physics deluxe, most of Jason Rohrer and Petri Purho, world of goo's framework is open source
x/game maker - for non-programmers, too limiting
sfml
cocos2d - 2d, Objective-C, iOS, OpenGL-ES
x/love - 2d, lua, windows/mac/linux, lua is terrible
processing - java, mainly for prototyping or interaction design for creative people, can use for quick sketches

flash libraries - flixel, flashpunk, pushbutton
  Starling - an optimized version of Flash for mobile devices 
  - only use if Flash version cannot be optimized

other libraries
physics engines - Box2d, Farseer for XNA
tweening - greensock tweenmax for flash

flash specific
signals - for flash, as3-signals or turbosignals
gamepad - simulates gamepad keys for keyboard, http://blog.iainlobb.com/2010/04/introducing-gamepad.html
