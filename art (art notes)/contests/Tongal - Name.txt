A key component of this new program is a website where the workflow will mirror the following:
 
1. Thought Leaders submit Challenges to the community in the form of topical questions. 

2. Users will then submit video content that answers the challenge topic. 

3. The community and the submitters can then browse and rate content so that the best videos rise to the top. 

4. Additionally, Thought Leaders, or mentors, from each topic will be viewing submitted content, engaging with users, and ultimately providing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for the top picks. 
 
The program's tagline is "Create. Connect. Be noticed."


Lastly, the sponsor is also keen to the idea of something that evokes an emotional attachment.


--Larger Goals: To grow an inclusive community that fosters creativity and provides unique recognition and access to exclusive tools and experiences that are once-in-a-lifetime for most people.
 
--Target Audience: We are looking to appeal to a very broad audience (film buffs, tech and info junkies, sports enthusiasts, home makers, etc.).
 
--Exposure: The sponsor will be hosting the website on the domain name chosen. The name will also be the name of the program and all promotional outreach, collateral, literature and brand identity and design will be based off this name.
