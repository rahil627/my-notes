Make a video for:
A stop-motion sequence of duck tape rolling along and suddenly taping things that need to be taped. Plugging holes, tightening fittings, wrapping itself around things taping them and rolling on

start with the duck tape rolling
pan to the side of it
like a sidescroller the duck tape should keep rolling and fix things in the background (or it could wrap around objects to fix them)
it could side scroll around an entire room (the duck tape can roll up counters)
then when the duck tape reaches it's starting position, the camera zooms out
showing the entire room, pan around the room, showing everything in amazement, wait a second on one of these frames
then show then show the duck tape itself
hold a frame and overlay the logo onto the frame

smaller ideas:
before the duck tape passes an object, it is unfixed, after it passes it is fixed, the object being hidden behind the duck tape.
while rolling, roll the camera around too
move other objects around, like the tool fish short

objects to fix:
could fix a person, a broken arm?, or a piece of clothing, the person should be sad at first, then happy after fixeds

setting:
outside?
a room?
a hallway/wall?
the setting should be disastrous, water spilling, open electric wire, cracked glass, hanging posters/pictures, tape wire down, ripped clothing

technical:
get different angles of everything since you are able to in stop mation. Can chase the duck tape, or go in front, on top, anything!

music
may need to choose music and fit the film to according to it
