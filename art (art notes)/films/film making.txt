Hirokazu Koreeda
  - I think we can create something that had not been prepared or planned beforehand but instead can create more natural and spontaneous moments in the film. That’s what I hoped I created, anyway. It’s not my conviction.
  - Let’s the children do what they want, and the adults act upon that.
  - In Like Father, Like Son, he shot from the perspective of adults. In Nobody Knows, the children.
  - I try to come up with the most suitable way to depict each actor. It varies with each film as I think my way through it.
  - When I try to create a scene for a single day, I am very conscious that, I would like to make a scene that make the audience how those characters have lived yesterday and lead their lives tomorrow.
  - I want the people who watch this movie to think about what these two families will do tomorrow. I don’t want them to end the film, but I want people to wander, whatever happened. What are they going to do? How are they? I’ve had this policy of making movies which enable the audience to imagine those things, or to make the sequence of the movie in their heads.
  - I’m note sure if it’s going to be next year, but I am going to continuously work on family dramas

  - Having a child makes a man a father, I tried to depict the story of one man’s growth to realize that
  - in the 60’s/70’s society always chose blood relations, but now that’s changing, Koreeda and his wife would choose nurture
  - the digital camera and photos by the children represent another timeline, the children’s emotions, perspectives, and memories, which was left behind, unseen, because the film was shot from an adult’s perspective
  - When I was making a film, I didn’t have time to spend with my daughter, then I found this picture of me sleeping taken by my daughter in the morning of that day. My sleeping face was really weird in that picture. And I don’t know what to say, but I was pretty amazed. That experience with my daughter created that scene.

  - Herzog masterclass
  - does not like cinema verite, one must direct a documentary, not wait like a bank security camera for a robbery
  - everyone can make a feature film with $10,000
  - 4 months traveling by foot is better than 4 years of film school
  - read books, to gain other’s perspectives
  - raise children, people that do are better grounded in reality
  - does not write screenplay for documentaries
    - except grudgingly for tv studios, lol
  - writes screenplays for feature films which takes 5 days
  - never show anything in a documentary, “they will be self-conscious”
  - never made a choice in his career, need makes choice in subject, just comes, vehemently
  - just an idea, an image, the beginning of a story is enough, find ways to complete it
  - never turn off the camera, talking about silent moments in film

notes from The River:
  - Shot location doesn’t matter. Everything is beautiful, natural.
  - need to experience life then write a screenplay.

  - a documentary about Christopher Doyle
  - a beatnik, well-travelled, cultured, 
  - walks a lot
  - improvised shots
  - i'm a cinematographer, not a screenwriter or filmmaker, i only care for images
  - in the mood for love could have easily been shot in Taipei, in my neighborhood, but I lose the beauty of it once I live in the place for too long, or I'm just not focusing on it.
  - he walks around to get ideas, it excites him, stole shots from airport and subway*****
  - made 7 films within walking distance of his home, and 1 within his home!
  - drinks often, perhaps I need to too, to relax

  - another dude
  - marginal people of society excite him, their will to live

To me it takes as much time to prepare a commercial, if you direct it, as it does to shot “Underwater Love,” so I rather do the film than a commercial (laughs).
—

films used to affect me deeply, now I desire real interaction

contemporary film feels better to me because I can relate to it. Time period films are more distant.

Tsai Ming-Liang:
http://www.yale.edu/wake/fall03/tsai.html
  - How do you approach writing your scripts? Do you provide much space for improvisation and spontaneity when shooting?
    My scripts are very small. They're like poetry, only containing instructions on how to make my films. When I write my scripts, there is no dialogue for the actors, but I communicate a lot with them so that when they are in settings, they have an idea of how to communicate their characters. This style lets actors experience life and act in the film. My actors are not like Hollywood actors-they are not taught how to act or speak. My actors seem like real people. You don't think of them as performing. I always give the actors a lot of time within the shot. I wait and then they act naturally. This is the best technique.

  - I agree with Chris on so many levels.

The Cannes film winners are completely new ideas. Creative. Reminds me of nothing I've seen before. That's how art should be.

Old thought from composition book:
Why create a historical film when a modern film will become history?

Documentary film is not fine art. It's purpose is to expose a subject. An investigation.

If one wants to create a universal film, one shouldn't have to sacrifice innovation. Do both. Like modern Pixar films.

It's amazing how perfect Studio Ghibli's films blend human qualities -- interaction, exploration, emotions and fantasy.

  - an interesting manifesto

an e-mail to Jon:
Films are kinda hard to make: https://vimeo.com/55547982 .

Or at least the way I want to. My process is non-sensical and highlights my lack of patience in design. Instead of the standard screenplay -> hire -> shoot -> post, I just interviewed and shot at once. Despite it being unwatchable it does contain qualities of film I like: social realism, human struggle, observing lower class, camera motion.
...
Also, documentary filmmaking is funky.

I feel like I'm using film as a tool to meet people and ask them questions that they normally would not agree to talk about. I've interviewed many lower class past generation Chinese artisans, questioning them about their work and lives. It's disheartening to do this stuff alone. Mad respect to those documentarians / journalists that are in the middle of wars and crises.

idea:
Be a part of someone's life. Affect their life significantly. Film what happens. Examples: buy off a prostitute, help a bum, help people.

Films that take place in natural settings are far more interesting.

GET THE PROCESS / SET UP DOWN
  - should be able to shoot and edit a short film in one day

"Your camera needs to act as a sort of metaphor to things happening in your story".

Vincent Moon:
"Now Iím going to Colombia for 2 weeks, then for 3 months in Indonesia to score a documentary on local traditional music. When I go to a new place, I donít have any contact, I just go there, I have a look around, then I think about what to do and finally I score a movie."

Open endings are so much better.

Watching films is a big part of film making.

starting in a highly developed city would be such as NY would be much easier, due to similar minded people that may be interested to work together
  - this turned out to be wrong!

http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21398
  - great read
  - "Itís not always about bands playing their music acoustically, the idea is ñ how can you push a band in another situation and see what happens?"

Filming contemporary artists is kind of like game jams. It's about meeting people, making something together, sharing a moment of creativity.

even in event photography, many cool ideas can arise:
  - filming dancers by dancing with them
  - filming musicians in their own region
  - filming traditional rituals, in all it's color, images, beauty, and power

from agenda:
Film the struggle of humans. Interesting subjects that involve struggle.

technical:
A Separation is either shot with a film camera or dslr capable of DOF. The stabilization is merely okay. The sound recording is perfect. Must be wireless lavalieres or an invisible audio guy. The shots and editing are perfect.

craigslist post of things I want to film:
I've been travelling for the past few months, and decided I want to make some films recently. I will list some possibilities. I'm looking for anyone sincerely interested and wants to create something together. There is no pay.

Possibilities include:
music video with independent Thai musician a la Vincent Moon
- a live performance walking through Sampeng lane
- a live performance on a tuk-tuk in traffic
- a live performance in your favorite secret area!

performance video of traditional culture
- traditional music
- hill-tribe ceremony?

short film involving human struggle in Bangkok
- find people to film, follow them for a day, ask them questions about life
- iOS social game playing young professional
- prostitute (cliche, but enticing)
- last generation Chinese laborer (likely providing a fortunate life for their kids)
- hawker stall person

films of the crew's interest

It may help to provide some of my favorite directors that are quite similar to the films I want to make:
Hirokazu Kore-eda
Rahmin Bahrani
Edward Yang
Carlos Reygaldas
Wong Kar-Wai (doesn't fit, but goddamn it's beautiful)

I have nearly no experience. A few weeks ago in Penang I created a poorly made short film about a roti delivery man on a bicycle (I'm currently trying to upload to vimeo, but am having troubles). I used my iPhone 4s.

I now have a Zoom h4n, and hopefully a camcorder (likely prosumer grade -- Panasonic hdc-x900m or similar) soon. 





Filmmaking is about meeting people and creating something together. The more connections, the better. Go out and talk to people. Not just anyone. Intelligent contacts, that have the knowledge of subjects or can think broadly to create film.

Should try to shoot the subject around the beautiful city/area they inhabit.

good reads:

Music videos a la Vincent Moon is an easy way to make film and meet people.

Can think of experimental film ideas that push the medium.

see iPhone for amazing note****

Like Humans of New York, I should be able to create one film per week, showing the a day of life a single person. Anyone. *************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Edit the film until I feel it's good enough. Don't just stop and give up partly through with it, just for the sake of finishing it. Editing film takes no time, especially compared to games.

If I were to continue filming in the way I filmed Roti Baker, it will be very difficult to develop tension, a climax. Carlos Reygaldas (and many other directors I like) casted local non-actors, then told them to act like themselves. Perhaps this is a better method. It retains authenticity of local people, yet allows the director to create a standard film.

Travel filming is interesting. Going to a new place, wandering around, and finding something to film. It's an awesome way to transform consumption into art.


The way I filmed Roti Baker Delivery was interesting. I found a subject I was interested in, I asked if I could film, set a date, followed the subject for a few hours, then created a film out of it. This is precisely my interest in film. I enjoy observing human struggle, especially from the lower class. Rahmin Bahrani, "Take Out", and Vincent Moon are the closest to what I created. I need to aim higher though, up to Hirokazu Kooreda and Ozu.





Should focus on imagery, color.

Film takes time. Time to set up an appointment, a shot, and post-production. Take your time. Although it feels like it takes much effort to setup, it's infinitely faster than making a game.

I think the reason I want to film in a similar manner to Vincent Moon is because he seeks to capture people in the most rawest fashion. People, being themselves, in their own place. It's a moment that cannot be recreated.

Music videos don't show the band singing, so it creates a fake barrier. Live performances are boring to watch. Placing the performer in a way that involves motion keeps the viewer satisfied, whilst offering a performance.

while watching the terrorizers:
  - have a slow pace is okay, so many scenes aren't needed, just scenes that make an impact, an image that lasts, retime it to stay longer

the best camera practice is to shoot an event or documentary
  - people dancing, have to dance with them

iPhone setup vs camcorder
  - iPhone
    - need to buy something to hold the iPhone and directional mic

photo essays are a step higher in BORING than documentaries. Images and dialogue? Awful.

lock exposure to highest in sunlight

for Vincent Moon style videos, need a omnidirectional mic with wind blocking
  - iPad and iPhone mic with wind blocking vs zoom h4n stereo mic with wind blocking
  - can't mix audio, likely sounds different
for interviews, can use omnidirectional, directional, or lapel
for everything else, use directional or omnidirectional?

don't worry, go slow, do it well

1. try editing toy museum audio
2. try schedule appointments for shooting for next week? Is iPad good enough if I use it properly?
3. order audio
  - Google iPhone/iPad 3.5mm adapter for Malaysia, cheap and fast
  - if not, order from B&H and ship to Malaysia
    - my hostel is $10/day

good iPhone filming link:

can enter videos to iPhone contests! Look for Penang filmmaking community/contests.


The reason I don't enjoy documentaries is because words and images are not as exciting as action. I need the video to the tell story. I can wikipedia most documentaries and receive the same information. Films need to tell more.

How to begin film?
  - go outside with an iPhone, find a subject, ask to shoot, shoot, edit, publish, repeat. That's it.*****
    - Well almost. A film needs an interesting subject or an idea. Otherwise, it's just crap. Simply making film does increase the technical skill though.

A feature film can be shot in two weeks, easily.

from Kubrick wiki:

Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months ... he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing.

I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking. . . . Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art formóa point so important it cannot be overstressed. . . It can make or break a film

He also felt that building scenes from images great music often created the "most memorable scenes" in the best films

While his films are all very different from each other . . . there is something that connects them all, and that is a very serious look at human nature, at human frailty.

always said that it was better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he's always done, except with Lolita

Kubrick read Pudovkinís seminal theoretical work, Film Technique, which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, and it needs to be employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest.

Christopher Doyle
http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0236313/bio
- "I feel that 2046 is unnecessary, in retrospect. I think probably Wong Kar-Wai realized that somewhere, and that's why it took so long. You do realize that you have basically said what you needed to say, so why say more? I feel that way. I think you have to move on."

  - "I didn't start making films until I was 34.But that wasted youth was probably the most valuable asset for what I'm doing now. You see the world, you end up in jail three or four times, you accumulate experience. And it gives you something to say. If you don't have anything to say then you shouldn't be making films. It's nothing to do with what lens you're using."

  - "I went to France and tried to learn cinematography. Then I realized that I didn't care. So I came back to making films as I could. I think I started to know what I was doing in the middle of "Days of Being Wild" (in 1991). You can't learn how to make films. You gotta make mistakes and you have to appropriate the mistakes, and then you learn from those things. Then you have a voice."

an interview with Christopher Doyle. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuWZI0yUUHU
  - In my world, I think space can be formed by light to create poetry.
  - A cinematogapher tries to translate ideas into images. How to translate this story into this space.
  - Some people do it by reading, and studying, other masters, whether it's painting or the history of the color and doing research like that. I think someone like me tends to walk into this bar and see how really blue I feel.
  - "Lives in close quarters, not Hollywood style. Population density doesn't bother? him. Being close to people doesn't bother him. That's why his best scenes are slow, tight and intimate." - a youtube comment
 
... from another interview with Christopher Doyle
- I think that's what cinema's all about. I have this experience, let me share it with you, therefore it is universal.
- Why does one make a film? Because you want to be with people you like.

- It's not about what you have done. It's what you do next is what you are.

You have to find the film, not make the film. The film is there somewhere; In your heart, or in the words, in the space you're working in, or in the colors, or the environment, or the amount of money you have, it's there somewhere, but it's not something you can say, "oh, this will be the film". You have to work very hard to find it.

the function of an artist is to open peopleís eyes

it seems like the relation of space and color is what Doyle considers his base.

http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/fall2005/features/wild_man.php

DOYLE: I mean, I go to NYU, and all the teachers are there, and then theyíre interpreting what I say. I say, ìJust do it.î And the teachers say, ìWhat he really means is if you really work hard within the system, then youíll get somewhere.î [laughs] So what can we do? Well, thereís a lot we can do that is not expensive. You could send a DVD to your friends, it could be online, and you could be in all these film festivals. And just with a digital camera. In other words, you could even make a film with your bloody phone now, you know what I mean? [laughs] Isnít that fantastic in a certain way? Itís so strange that young people are actually hedging their bets instead of just going out there and starting to do stuff. The only way that any of us became so-called filmmakers is by not hedging the bets, and trying, and then seeing if something works. Donít worry. Yeah, people can steal your ideas, but theyíre not going to steal your heart. [laughs] What are you going to do? Are you going to wait? I mean, look what happened to Kubrick. The more he waited ó I mean, Eyes Wide Shut is a piece of shit, come on. Itís flustered; itís someone frustrated by his own ideas. Itís like cheese; it molded, you know? [laughs] Maybe 20 years ago it would have been more interesting, but it has no relevance anymore. And you canít do that. Because what we do is a product of where we are. I mean, all the films Iíve made are a response to the films Iíve made before, and hopefully a response to whatever sociopolitical environment Iím living in.

FILMMAKER: How would you compare the experience maybe of working on a film that you shot quickly, like Chungking Express, as opposed to a film that took a long time, like 2046?

DOYLE: I think your real question is, Where is the energy? I think the energy is in the eclectic mixture of people with a certain intention sharing it. And like in 2046, what happens is that it becomes too ethereal, and I think the audience feels that. I really believe that if we are energized, if we are encountering something, if we are sharing something, then the audience will share the same thing. Now with 2046, it was a five-year shoot, and then youíve got all the ups and downs with whatever it is, whether itís accounting problems or itís stylistic problems or whatever ó doesnít matter. What happens is that it becomes a much more methodical kind of film. It has a certain austerity. Whereas a film like Chungking Express, we needed to get it done at that time and we did. And I think in another way, the ìDumplingsî or the Thai films that Iíve done, I think they all have that integrity, which is, Yes, here we go. Itís not more or less than what it is. I think our purpose as filmmakers or as storytellers or whatever youíre going to call us is to say that at this particular point with this relationship, with this social structure, in this political climate, this is the best film I could do. I think thatís all we can do. Then weíre not exploitative, weíre not the Spielbergs or the whatever. Then it becomes extremely personal, for better or worse. So donít get confused by digital or non-digital or money or not ó just do the best fucking film you can with your abilities at that time. I mean, why else do we make films when we could have gone into real estate? [laughs]


FILMMAKER: How do you pick which films you work on?

DOYLE: People, always people.


buy a camcorder

personal values:
It seems I'm more interested in making films that are characteristically natural like some of my favorite directors: Hirokazu Koreeda, Carlos Reygaldas. Hiring non-actors, letting the script evolve, no stringent storyboard. But not so much to the extent of cinema verite and documentaries. Although these may be more fun to shoot, observing life.

software:
  Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere Pro
    - often depends on camera as some software can natively take in camera footage
    - although, I'd stick with FCP for simple design and stability
  DaVinci Resolve?

after debating over which camera to buy, a DSLR, a consumer camcorder, or a film camera, and after watching videos of people who used DSLRs and make achieve that "film look" and shallow depth of field, I realized cinematography is only a small part of filmmaking. A film with a shitty camcorder with better narrative and taste can make something far better, new, unique. Enter short film competitions, for the creativity.

a film doesn't need to have a narrative. Even if it were just nice visuals and ambient noise, it would still serve as a retreat for the working people. If they don't go out to see the world, then I can show them.

it's nice to see films which show the setting for a while before shifting to narrative. It's a good time to take advantage of visuals, set the pace, let the audience meditate. Examples: 35 Shots, Walking Life
