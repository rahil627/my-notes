iPhone:
- records in mono
  - [FCP bug] when export h.264, the mono sound goes to right speaker
    - Press Cmd-J for project properties. Click the wrench in the lower right. Change the audio output from surround to stereo. Check the meters again. [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4004714?start=0&tstart=0]
   

shooting:
- keep shooting, can cut later

- light actors
- keep mic steady, or have lapel mic
- test audio with headphones
- shoot from chest
- follow subject, follow the action


- can't run
- can't walk down stairs
- can't walk?
  - need image stabilization or a camcorder


editing:
order:
- trash clips using camera
- import to two external drives
- rename clips
- create 24p project
- analyze and transcode media / import to FCP
- edit
- add effects (titles, color, special effects)

publish:
- export web hosting (quicktime movie) and then import the clip, then share to vimeo

- vimeo:
  - http://vimeo.com/help/compression
  - export to h264 following the above link's settings
  - can try FCP publish to Vimeo option, then salvage the movie and manually upload if it fails to auto-upload
  - use share -> apple device vs computer vs web hosting?
  - 500mb/week limit

FCP settings:
  - checkbox under settings -> playback -> use proxy media

how to:
cut audio
  - open in timeline, blade offending section, use trim tool to drag
disable audio
  - Window - Show Timeline Index - Roles - Uncheck the audio (dialogue) box

todo:
- final cut playback is eating CPU and sometimes choppy
  - transcode to prores 442 ("optimized")
    - 10x larger file size
  - test editing and image quality difference between "optimized" and "proxy"

    - before exporting, remember to change to optimized playback
- test FCP analysis and stabilization difference
  - note processing time / video time for 24p for core 2 duo
