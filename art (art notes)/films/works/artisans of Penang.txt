Should it be separate or combined?


interesting subjects:
  - Hokkien puppet troupe owner and Teochew puppet troupe owner
  - Chef extraordinaire/Floral Designer & Instructor
  - Thai Menora Performer / Cultural Expert / Shaman (84 years)
  - goldsmith and carpenter's guilds
  - Kongsis


Just shoot as much as you can. Figure it out later. Let the artisan talk, but guide them toward larger questions of life. Then match the audio to video. Stay in Penang, edit here, can shoot more if needed.

shoot interview (video and audio). Shoot process. Shoot around.


What is this film about?
  - the process?
  - the past, present, and future of Georgetown
  - the place of artisans
  - shoot for two films? One personal (episodic), one overall?

questions:
Coffee maker moved out. Who else moved out, went out of business, or passed away?
How were times before?
What will happen when they are gone? Is there a space for hand-crafting, or are factories enough? Will the next generation be willing to take on such tedious work?

do some research!

  - “perpetuate and develop traditional skills and techniques, transmit these through a prescribed training system, aid in marketing and strive to generate income so that the skills becomes attractive as a viable life choice career for young people”



can the series be made on to a documentary?
  - a compilation of multiple shorts versus a single film
    - I'd rather do a compilation of multiple shorts for the sake of getting technically better, or else I'd have to stick with the same format throughout

other media:
8 Mini Centuries
  - a film in which 8 actors/actresses talk to 8 heritage sites, 8 episodes
  - http://www.8tv.com.my/schedule/comingsoon/8_Mini_Centuries.html
  - the host is affected by the contact with the heritage site, a lesson is learned
    - this may be a better angle as it affects the host
    - they probably shoot the process, ask questions on life, with some cheesy actor. I'd rather keep researching and shooting, finding answers of how the past life of Georgetown was, and what it will happen when it's gone.
