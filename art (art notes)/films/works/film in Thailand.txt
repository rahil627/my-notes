 GOALS:
   - film experimental performances in Bangkok and Chiang Mai
   1. research
     - individual musicians, dancers, and nearly anything else that would make a nice film
     - venues
     - universities
   2. contact
   3. film
   
   conclusion:
   - very few experimental performers exist
     - ask the few experimental people I found
     - try asking some of the most popular ones?
     - try traditional music and performers?'
       - if it's traditional, it must take place in the original setting, I must travel to them. Avoid contemporary copies of traditional performances.
   - at this point, I think I should contact anyone and everyone, just for the experience
   x/- can physically go to dance companies in Bangkok
     - it's faster to contact through internet
   x/- can physically go to record labels in Bangkok
     - it's faster to contact through internet
   - take nearly any response! See where it goes. See what the result it.
   
   DON'T GIVE UP. NEED AT LEAST A FEW RECORDED PERFORMANCES! STAY IN BANGKOK. CONTEMPORARY OR POP MUSICIANS.
   
   - try asking record labels to forward the message to artists?
     - not really independent eh?
   - try university students
     - chulalongkorn
     - cmu
     
   I AM THE ORGANIZER. I AM THE JOB CREATOR.
   
   THE SUBJECT SHOULD BE INTERESTING, OR ELSE NO ONE WILL CARE
     - either popular or talented, nothing in between
     
   maybe I'm not researching correctly, perhaps the great upcoming artists have no videos on youtube, no record, don't attend festivals (well, this doesn't make sense). Maybe I can find them on online sites such as soundcloud. Search by location, then keywords.

    - Instead of impromptu filming like the Take Away Show, we can quickly have an idea and create it, still live, likely few edits, but perhaps some intended imagery. I guess this is just a live perfomance, but in a public area. For example, it could take place at a night market, and a few planned shots. It's like creating a film together, in a day. So, it's a true collaboration, in which the film's auteur is not just me. A new idea, a new experiment, a new film everytime. People shouldn't realized that it was made by me. Perhaps it's a dance with the camera, it takes place in an interative art installation, it involves the performer's family. Either way, it should be done live. Even if the video is edited and the clips aren't sequential, the sounds should differentiate from the album.
    
    Perhaps this is my way creating film. I'm too impatient to create a film grand in scope, so instead, I organize a film jam. Or perhaps this is my way of starting film. I attended game jams, and now I feel I am ready to make greater products. Perhaps not grand in scope, but a great idea, and a great game. In a similar manner, I would hope that with experience, I could eventually create great films.
    
    I guess my work is experimental. A new work every time.

research and contact traditional musicians

research and contact filmmakers who want to make contemporary films



http://www.kickthemachine.com/links/index.html













message to musicians:

Hey Derdamissyou.

I'm travelling through Thailand right now and am planning to make some music videos with upcoming contemporary independent musicians.

This rigorous craigslist post lists my intentions: http://bangkok.craigslist.co.th/cwg/3468679891.html.

Basically, I want to create one-shot (or small number of shots) music videos in an impromptu fashion near the area you live in. I'm currently in Bangkok, and I think it would be really cool to shoot a video while walking through Sampeng lane in Chinatown. Of course, this may not be possible as your music is electronic. Anyway, I'm willing to work together and create something rather quickly. I will travel to you. I will purchase whatever is necessary for the idea. I think the closest filmmaker who does this kind of thing is Vincent Moon (https://vimeo.com/vincentmoon/videos, example: https://vimeo.com/9963936). His videos are really close to my vision of mixing travel, filmmaking, and meeting people.

Anyway, I'm currently researching indie musicians. Your band just happened to be the first one in which I sincerely enjoyed listening to.

Hope to hear from ya soon!






craigslist:
I've been travelling for the past few months, and decided I want to make some films recently. I will list some possibilities. I'm looking for anyone sincerely interested and wants to create something together - film crew and performers. There is no pay.

Possibilities include:
music video with contemporary independent Thai musician a la Vincent Moon
  - examples:
  - a live performance walking through Sampeng lane or on a tuk-tuk
  - a live performance in your in your favorite area: a quiet street near a residential area, your grandma's house, in a beautiful derelict building
  - the idea is not to merely record a performance or match images to music or to create a pop short film that somewhat fits the song, but to capture an inimitable moment that showcases the performer, their personality, and the environment they come from. I want the video to be an extension of the performer.

performance video of traditional culture
  - traditional music
  - hill-tribe ceremony?
  - the idea is the same for the music video, except applied to traditional performances

short film involving human struggle in Bangkok
  - find people to film, follow them for a day, ask them questions about life  -- who are they? Why are they working this job? Where is their family? Where did they come from? -- Or maybe not ask questions and just watch and learn.
    - prostitute (cliche, but enticing)
    - last generation Chinese laborer (likely providing a fortunate life for their bubble tea sipping kids)
    - hawker stall person

short film involves criticism or observations of contemporary society
  -  an iOS social game playing young professional
  - a universal narrative that takes place in a developed part of the city
  - the contrast of social classes in the city

Of course the films are not limited to this. Any collaborator's input is valued.

It may help to provide some of my favorite directors that are quite similar to the films I want to make:
Hirokazu Kore-eda
Rahmin Bahrani
Edward Yang
Carlos Reygaldas
Wong Kar-Wai (doesn't fit, but goddamn it's beautiful)

Maybe the theme here is social realism? Showing the unfortunate struggle, so that the fortunate movie watchers remember how fortunate they are....FORTUNE!

I have nearly no experience. My past experience involves game design (rahilpatel.com). A few weeks ago in Penang I created a poorly made short film about a roti delivery man (https://vimeo.com/55341132). I used my iPhone 4s.

I now have a Zoom h4n, and hopefully a camcorder (likely prosumer grade -- Panasonic hdc-x900m or similar) soon.

I can only be in Thailand for 60 days. Lets make stuff!




Hey Christy (or whoever runs the site!),

I'm interested in creating a short film with you. It should only take a single day.

As a reference to what kind of film, watch a film from the take away show by Vincent Moon (https://vimeo.com/blogotheque).

The idea is not to merely record a performance or match images to music or to create a pop short film that somewhat fits the song, but to capture an inimitable moment that showcases the performer, their personality, and the environment they come from. I want the video to be an extension of the performer, so that the viewer gets a better understanding of who they are. I want to work with the performer to conceptualize, create, and implement an idea in a small time frame. And hopefully, the result will be a recording of an interesting moment in time.

Just reply if you're interested! I travel, and will likely be in Thailand for about 30 days.

Thanks,
Rahil
