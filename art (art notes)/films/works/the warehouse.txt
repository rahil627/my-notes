lessons learned:
iPhone is amazing
don't need to buy a stabilizer yet, but I haven't tried walking either
plan shooting because the more you shoot the more you have to edit. Also, don't take b-shots, just keep shooting the entire time. Can edit out images later.

todo after:
try walking shot


problem while changing songs
  - how to make transition smooth?
    - try to find good time to transition audio
    - use another video on top?
    - find way to crossfade audio
      - need motion 5 for audio transition (crossfade)?
        - no! Can do it in FCP X
     


middle:
- the middle scenes still feels funny
- long pan?
- add band playing?
- add band playing in slow mo?




cut a little from the first set of clips, cut to singer when she begins singing
  - add transition?
  - add title
play with later clips to see length, to determine how much music to use
  - retime end clips, only use nice shots, like the light one
  - retime be alrightâ€¦ to be really long and go over the end of the song


what should the video be about?

One song.
add more to begin and end?
what order?
do other clips intersect throughout the song?
i think it should be about the warehouse, not just the song
  - in this case, it's okay to mix other times
  - just show that the warehouse is about having a good time
    - dancing, the employees, the venue, etc.

goal:
  - capture the sounds and atmosphere of The Warehouse


edit:
begin with entrance
start the audio of the performance, before the song begins
b-shots of venue (goes to beginning or end?)
  - employees
  - people chatting, chillin'
mostly consists of the performance
first very long take, including pan?
in the middle show b-shots of dancing, dreamy, fun
  - drown sound
guitar solo
more b-shots of people being happy, hugs, more dancing and playing instruments to reggae, fading away, memory-like, slow (use retime) like wong-kar-wai
  - starts out at normal speed, once people start dancing, use the same clip to transition to slow down, then retime
  - images of people dancing, having fun, find those moments, slow it down
  - don't forget images of the performance!

color grade, blues purples during dancing

performance is too long, must cut
- find a beginning and end
- looks like 2 songs and an ending
- separate songs, compare, choose one, or mix?





order:
- trash clips using camera
- trash clips before import, using laptop
- import
- transcode? or transcode and analyze and fix
- edit clips
- analyze and fix?
- arrange
- add effects
  - color grading
    - grainy, super 8, blacks, shadow feeling
  - fades, blends
  - should be dreamy, dark, noir, contrasting colors
  - dreamy, blend b-shots, keep focus on performance
- add titles
  - Fatimah at The Warehouse in Kuala Lumpur
  - show "Kuala Lumpur" while showing The Warehouse sign clip
  - show "Fatimah and the house band" (get name from Ebrahim) when she appears

- large effects, all black for a moment, etc.
  - watch more Vincent Moon tonight
- export
