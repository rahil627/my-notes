  - One guy said no. It was likely due to my abruptness.

culture:

food stalls

experimental:
something that makes use of the colorful city, shophouses, old streets, a juxtaposition, high contrast with color, imagery, Wong Kar-Wai shit

2. Google websites
3. see music videos of Malaysian artists to gauge music videos
4. listen to Malaysian musicians
  - Ferns, cute, poppy music
  - Citizens of Ice Cream’, pretty cool post-rock
  - Reset to Zilch, dark post-rock
  - +2b, I like, cheap snythy music with some beats, and a sweet voice*
    - may not be able to play acoustically, or even live

5. contact favorite Malaysian musicians
  - create core message

6. Google more things to film, get in contact with local media, filmmakers, any local gigs, volunteer work, anything! Use the websites Kim gave me to start with.
  - especially in Penang
  - also, undeveloped areas, like documenting aboriginal stuff


message to +2db:

subject:
Want to make a music video?

Hey +2db,

I'm Rahil, and I want to make a music video, of you two. I should be available in Malaysia for the next few weeks. I will travel to you, find a cool place to shoot nearby (you can help me!), and edit. 

I've found you through the-wknd, which I heard about after meeting some cool kids at an open mic at a venue (The Warehouse) near my hostel in the old city centre of Kuala Lumpur. I enjoy your sound.

The only problem I foresee is that your music is mostly electronic. I'm not sure if you can perform live, or acoustically, but maybe something could be worked out?

Anyway, you can read more about me below.

Thanks for reading,
Rahil

My story / why:
I'm an Indian American. I'm really interested in film and game/interaction design. I decided to go to India to work on a game independently, but before that I decided to do a little traveling en route, so I went to Taiwan, did some work exchange, circumnavigated the country, bought a ticket to Singapore before my visa expired, bussed to Kuala Lumpur because Singapore is expensive yo, overate, bussed to Penang, and now I want to make some stuff. I've decided I want to begin making films. To start, I want to create music videos of contemporary artists, and possibly document some cultural things.

I want to do this in a particular way, something akin to Vincent Moon. That is, I want to shoot it in one take, in a local place: on a rickshaw in Penang, at a Chinese temple, in a neighborhood street in Little India, at your secret favorite place.

I've never made a film before. I mean, I know how to technically do it, but never for the sake of personal art. I want to shoot solely with my iPhone. If I find this impossible, I'll buy a camcorder. For the most part, I want to keep it lo-fi.

This is something I personally want to do. No money is involved, so I would not be able to pay anyone. It is a way for me to meet people and create something while traveling, as I've found traveling without people or work is meaningless.
