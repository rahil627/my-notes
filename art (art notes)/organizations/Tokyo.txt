Hey Minoru,

I'm in need of a odd favor. I would like ask some questions and perhaps heed some advice about working in Tokyo and participating in the art (fine and commercial) community.

The reason for this is because I am contemplating of moving to Tokyo after my travels and I am currently gathering some information before I move in.

I found you through the Tokyo University of Arts website, and figured you might have knowledge of the current status of Tokyo's contemporary art scene, media, and research.

The questions:

- Is there a great language barrier in the creative / professional echelon?
- Does Tokyo have the highest creative capital in East Asia? I imagine only Hong Kong compares.
- Is there a game development community? A new media community? A film community? Are they supported by higher education? If you happen to know any organizations, could you share some?
- Are there sufficient events related to the development of innovative media and research? Game playtest sessions, new media installations, research in robotics, mixing of technology and health or education, etc. If you happen to know any events, could you share some?

These are admittedly weird factors, but they are somewhat important for me as they help me find people I would collaborate with immediately, and provide me community support. My first goal is to simply meet people, and related organizations and events are a great way to meet the right people.

If you have more time check out the following links to understand where I'm coming from:

Thanks anyway.
