Dance*
  - design
    - gameplay
      - timed horse
        - time increases with turn
        - only resets on new game
        - three stock
          - adjustable
      - start from a starting point, end from an ending point (or line)
        - if fail to end, the player fails
      - should the dancer intently move toward the current touch or should it slowly move toward it?
        - should be able to adjust this value
      - lose when player fails to be within the correct area for longer than a certain amount of time (adjustable)
      - (extra) could replay the moves before the next player's turn to copy, so that it is easier to see and remember
        - or could just hand the iPad over
    - theme
      - paint
        - each path paints onto the canvas
        - watercolor?
        - thin lines
      - dance
        - dancer animates, certain gestures causes dancer to animate
          - ice skating*
            - twirl, jump twirl, double twirl, triple twirl
            - could still leave ice streaks, or colors, only the sprite is required
      - cave paintings
        - chalk on stone
        - low frame animation

  - implementation
    - HaxePunk or Cocos2d

EGP construct
  - done?
    - check world of good tower building gameplay
      - youtube "world of goo record" and "world of goo multiplayer"
  - design:
  - gameplay
    - stack building blocks to create a tall building, the player with the tallest building wins
    - once the building topples, the height counter stops and is measured against the opposing player
    - camera zooms out when the building becomes tall
      - two cameras, split screen
    - user interface for adding blocks
      - 1:
      - tap and hold to show block outline, let go to add vertical block
        - color outline green or red to display ability to add block
      - two finger touch and hold to add horizontal block
      - 2:
      - tap and hold to show block outline in last orientation, use second finger to twirl orientation
        - snap to perfect vertical and horizontal
    - with this design the player could just stack vertical blocks infinitely
    - limit the player from adding blocks directly to the building, forcing players to drop blocks a certain distance
    - maybe the player is unable to perfectly stack blocks due to difference in touch points

  - implementation:
  - HaxeFlixel (and Nape) or Cocos2d

Mime
  - design:
  - gameplay:
    - single touch:
    - creating
      - tap, tap and hold, nothing
    - matching
      - start point and end point, like a long step in DDR
    - multi touch:
      - creating
      - matching

  - theme:
   - quilt
   - pitch increases as touch moves right
     - taps play a single short-length note
     - have to choose a soothing instrument

  - implementation:
    - Flash or Haxe NME or Cocos2d
      - see how HaxePunk and HaxeFlixel handle sprite/entity with custom drawing
    - Flash and Haxe NME
      - using the drawing API, it may be limited to just solid colors, as opposed to fill texture of Cocos2d
    - proto; llvvb    type in Flash or Haxe NME, test quilt design later

Doodle Tangle
  - design:
  - gameplay:
  - 
  - theme:
  - 70s, like Drive, cheesy neon, flashing lights
    - uncreative
  - something smooth, inspired by the curves of the game

  - implementation:
  - HaxePunk or Cocos2d
  - prototype in HaxePunk?
    - is it worth the work?

  - the map / tile method will not work because each tile is unique
    - can still use tiles for certain objects
  - preload textures as the camera gets closer to them
    - automatically done in Unity?
    - when a new texture is added, detect the collision curves (edge)*
      - could be a colored line
  - see how that one hill game paints textures, through ray wenderlich's tutorial
    - I think it used Box2d to draw polygons
  - the problem is drawing filled textures
    - I do want curved lines though
  - the camera moves on a x-y coordinate plane, it's a matter of adding points


EGP Construct 2
  - idea:
  - create building blocks in augmented reality
  - multiplayer
    - players build a level together consisting of blocks which act as obstacles
    - players must then maneuver through without touching the blocks

  - design:
  - start simply with the add block to augmented reality space
  - then detect if iPad overlaps with a block
  - start / stop detection button
  - reset button to remove all blocks
  - interface to add blocks
    - start with center

  - implementation:
  - unity?
  - check that one image space application
    - creative frameworks?

touch vs tilt*
  - design:
  - see notebook
  - gyroscope controls road, touch controls car
  - due to the sensitivity of the gyroscope, it may be really difficult to control the road
  - game should be 2d
  - able to overlap roads
  - obstacles can be static and dynamic
  - coop mode:
  - what I normally imagine
  - vesus mode:
  - crazy road movement

  - implementation:
  - Flash, Haxe NME, Cocos2d
  - draw bezier curve and check collision against touch sprite
  - next point depends on gyromenter

EGP Construct 3:
  - idea:
  - use camera to create character animation for a simple fighting game
  
  - design:
  - each button is assigned an attack, players can create any attack
  - hitbox is automatically created around the character
  - how to determine winning attack?
    - STOPPED HERE

  - implementation:
  - Construct

EGP Construct ideas:
  - construct terrace farms with blocks
    - start with a randomly generated 3d mountain, click in a 3d grid to add a terrace block
    - no fun
  - should think about other user interfaces other than iPad and augmented reality
    - look up new user interfaces
  - projectors?
    - no different from screens, well, you can move projectors
    - games dealing with moving projectors?
      - really limited audience
  - cameras
    - take pictures of things and create a collage*

EGP Construct film ideas:
  - piece together a film
    - setting, narrative, actors, screenplay
      - in an order so that the audience only understands the story at the end
      - each piece should change the audience's perception of narrative
      - example: start with a dark setting, show actors having fun, show actors separately, play entire film

  - add pieces of film together
    - overlap*****
      - a train going through a city street
      - sloppy cutout instead of green screen
      - create an entire short film out of this mechanic!
     - can cut from my own video or other video*
     - surreal
       - created from real scenes (not animation)
       - play with size, dialogue*
         - bungee jumping over the himalayas
       - create machines*
         - use somersaulting swimmers as wheels of car
     - need a strong narrative
     - start with one film, introduce another, then more later, then back to one
