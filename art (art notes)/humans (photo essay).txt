Tips for humans:
See weather. Make route. Go while feeling good. Take a light bag. Focus on interesting people to get interesting stories. Vary people - age, diversity. Ask them to get in the middle of a street. Take time to take the photo.

To humans: remember to capture the city too. Take pictures of streets, storefronts, nature. Everything.

notes:
The photos rely on my mood. I need to be fun and cheerful to bring about fun photos. Or curious to bring out stories.

I also need to go during sunlight. Night requires more planning.
