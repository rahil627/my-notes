to tool-kit:

1. adjustable wrench ($4)
  - covers most common adjustment nuts, removing the need for a socket set. only need sockets for those nuts that are impossible to reach without an adjustable wrench (engine casing, spark plug, etc.)
  - although can remove and replace the tire nut, adding torque to a ratchet â€˜n socket is much easier and allows greater potential torque

pre-made multi-tools ($3):
  - todo: compare my old Leatherman multi-tool to the best bike tools, and figure out what the most used tools are
- normally contains a hex driver and common bits (flat, star), a blade, and pliers
- swivels: can turn like a standard straight driver or use it at any angle, including perpendicular, to make adding torque easier
  - Leatherman
  - Decathlon bike multi-tools

vice grips ($10):
  - a plier with the ability to lock in position, allowing one to focus all the torque on turning, instead of turning *and* clamping
  - like the adjustable wrench, it cover a lot of scenarios, but also like it, it cannot reach places where only sockets can

bits and sockets:
  - socket driver standard diameter sizes: 1/4in, 3/8in, 1/2in)
    - the larger the diameter of the bit driver, the larger the sockets it can handle. typically, for 1/4in, the largest socket size is 14mm

pre-selected bit and socket set:
BikeMaster driver set (1/4in, 3/8in)
  - 6, 8, 10, 12, 14mm sockets, #2 phillips socket
  - T-handle, each of the three ends have drivers
Casco 1/4in driver set
  - Japanese
  - ratchet, 3-14mm sockets, bit driver, common bits

custom:
ratchet
  - can have features: swivel, switch lock direction, button to detach
  - **$3 for the most basic 1/4in ratchet, all steel, the head moves along the base handle, allowing one to make an L-shape or a T-shape!**
T-shape driver
  - easier to torque the long-end than an L-shaped driver, allowing the use of two hands
L-shape driver?
  - i thought of this, but, it makes sense
bit socket
  - todo: what are the standard bit socket sizes?

flat screw bit
star screw bit
hex bit
... other common bits

socket driver set:
swivel socket driver
hex wrench

common motorcycle sockets:
23mm - spark plug
21mm - spark plug for my motorcycle
  - need to buy a separate tool ($3)
14mm - either the tire or near the tire
7mm - most popular screw size on the Kawasaki GTO

common bicycle sockets:
(see the BikeMaster driver set)

compare costs:
850th$ for the Casco bit and socket driver set
vs
custom:
140 adjustable wrench
100 bike tool or multi-tool
  - **todo: double-check prices** 
150 socket driver
75 per socket
  - need to find much cheaper sockets
  - need to find a cheap bit set that fits a normal socket
20 bit driver set (dollar-store quality)


tire levers
  - $1 for plastic

lubricating oil
  - $1
    - comes in a dropper container
  - $3 spray can
    - convenient way of lubing the entire motorcycle: just spray it all over the frame
