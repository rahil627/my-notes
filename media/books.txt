critical theory in film:
Without doubt the culture industry chapter of the ÒDialectics of EnlightmentÓ is among the most influential texts in the history of film and media theory. Together with AdornoÕs notes on cinema in the ÒMinima moraliaÓ

In his famous essay on the ÒEssay as formÓ from 1958 Adorno argues for a kind of critical writing that strategically subverts and transgresses disciplinary boundaries. 

Drawing on the Frankfurt SchoolÕs signature combination of neo-marxist analysis with Freudian psychoanalysis, Herbert Marcuse discussed the capitalist system of production in terms of a sublimation of desire in his book 1955 ÒEros and CivilizationÓ that an important reference for the generation of 68.

German experimental theater and radio in the 1920s, the television programs with avant-garde composes curated by Mauricio Kagel in the 1960s and 1970s and the new German cinema of Kluge and beyond all in varying degrees have use critical theory as a frame of reference. Jean-Luc Godard, a former critic who never ceased to be a critic, continues to acknowledge his debt to critical theory and to Benjamin and Adorno in particular in his work for cinema and television as does, of course, Kluge in his television work.

books I've read but do not make it to my library
  Harry Potter - my first
  Mountains of Madness - read by in drastic situation, a terrible book
  The Dark Knight Returns - boring in comparison to Watchmen, good use of television media though, and a really nice joker
  Angels and Demons - a cheap best seller thriller
  ? by Jon Klassen - an awesome tiny children's book with humor similar to Wes Anderson or Adventure Time
  The Killing Joke - quick read, really nice Joker psychology by Alan Moore

Books that I've glanced at but thought were useless or at least not thought-provoking:
  - can use goodreads and rate 1 star
  - The Writer and the World
    - not a smart observer, more like a simple traveler's blog, who doesn't think deeply into how the world came to be, urban or society.
  - Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life
    - interesting to read Benjamin's life, what media he consumed, his education, his travels. But the authors of the book are dull and make many simple statements of why Benjamin did certain things, or what influenced him.
