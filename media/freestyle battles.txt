i ain't talkin about that hard butter,
i mean yo mom's motha

freestyle verses:
you know why y'all in bad shape?,
'cause you got a lot of squares in your circle

i treat you like an old sneaker,
reachin in you, and ripping out your soul
i put a nike sign on your face,
and they gonna have to hold down your tongue to lace up the hole

tell me the truth,
you were sleepin on me,
well know you gonna have nightmare about me

your sister hole is deep enough to hide fishin' pole

he's chump change,
fuckin' with all these young dames,
his life would've been more if his father left him as a cum stain

		listen i'm the type to dick your wife
		you go down,
		you're a muff diver
		your bitch give me dome,
		while you sit at home like an umpire

		but you not safe,
		you better put on the lox,
		like a ruff rhyder,
		'cause i roll with big semis like a truck tire,
		and they open caps like a sun visor

		i'll run in this house and let the subs fire,
		and then put the can to your six pack like budweiser

		u never did a drive by real slow and shoot chrome,
		the only time you drive by is in a school zone

		shoot at him,
		but i won't miss the bus,
		i ain't kriss kross

		shots at the window, the gas tank, the tires like rip n tear,
		y'all can call it the magic school bus 'cause i'll make it disappear

		been burnin n shootin from all the triggers i've touched
		since y'all addicted to cash, i'll keep givin them bucks

		it don't matter what you poppin ars,
		you could spit fifty,
		you won't hit me,
		all yo shots gonna miss,
		'cause you from brick city
		
		i spray the tek,
		and i clutch and burst pipes,
		i'm the type to make sparks fly,
		like love at first sight
		
		it's a wrap for your head like a bandana,
		aim at his dreads,
		and i'll pop them locks like a break danca'
		
		but i don't want y'all take it as some sort of hate,
		since you from jersey,
		i put you all in the dirt,
		now y'all really can be the garden state
		
		but i fuck with the bricks,
		so ain't sayin that y'all all lame,
		but if y'all keep repping ars's name,
		and he say jersey through his blood and through all his veins/vain(?)
		i'ma get rid of the bricks like a ball and crane,
		and then retire jersey like the hall of fame
	
	p2
		the only thing you have in common with...tech nines and hallows,
		is that you spit the same line to both
		
		but i ain't mad at the shit you rectin' often,
		you did what's right ars,
		you supposed to recycle garbage
		
		you better sleep with one eye open like slick rick
		
		you just beatin yourself,
		you're the brad pitt of fight club
		
		i'll light slogs that a clipe/eclipse? spark
		at your feet so you can crip walk,
		get pissed off when i grip the steel,
		put him in a wheel chair,
		now you can be a crip for real
		
		lush you said at oakland they smoke grapes?,
		i bet in watts (watts, la) them grapes (grape street watts crips) smoke you
		
		see you stay yellin' to hide your lack of creativity,
		you get amped when you rappin',
		you screamin' for no reason,
		you samuel l jackson
		
		you got no character, no cadence, no lyrics either,
		a five dollar flow with no delivery,
		you litte caesar's
		
		and no crips believe you,
		'cause everything you say is a made up story,
		you never slide shelves in the fifth to makes sells on the strip to see the dough,
		you a TV show,
		all we hearin' is tales from the crip
		
		i'll dump the nine and snipe led,
		turn those dark blue chucks you always rap about to bright red,
		snipe led i'm and throwing up slogs,
		you might think he switched gangs when he throwin up blood
		
		the only way im window shoppin,
		is if im buying tints for the car
		
		i'm a creep,
		if your wrist chilly,
		i'll take away your left eye
		
	p2 vs cortez
		i could pull out the blades or remove guts
		since y'all all think you're soldiers,
		you can get your crew cut
		
		nigga you wouldn't even squeeze or put the aim on the toothbrush
		
		how the fuck you freeze against someone that light homes?
		he got nervous, screwed up,
		and kept repeating himself like mike jones
