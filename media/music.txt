They removed the flash and gloss of the disco-rap of the Sugar Hill label, and they influenced a young LL Cool J, who influenced Boogie Down Productions and Eric B & Rakim, who influenced the Juice Crew and Public Enemy and NWA, and on and on and on, as rap would undergo sea change after sea change. 

fix:

cut down ddr supernova
redownload - dark was the night - rename including the artists - find bonus tracks version
redownload - buckethead - population override
redownload - bajofando - mar dulce
