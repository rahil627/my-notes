metronomy - nights out - repetitive and simple
phantom planet - raise the dead - unoriginal, but fun
the felice brothers - the felice brothers - unoriginal, not as fun
the new puritans - beat pyramid - gets old/annoying
afrika bambaataa - first half is nice, the rest is not
built to spill - you in reverse - first 2 songs are nice, but then the songs feel streched for too long

kylie minogue - x - simple pop structures with nice hooks, some weak tracks
65daysofstatic - one time for all time	just seemed poppy, although not bad at all. it just didn't evoke many emotions from me.
dj quick and kurupt - the lyrics don't stand out, and the music is usually pretty fun FL studio material
major lazer - guns don't kill people... lazers do - pop dancehall, ugh.
beat happening - you turn me on - 80's-90's indie rock, cool, but just not enough sounds for variation
