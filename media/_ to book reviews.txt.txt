### translations of Laozi
Laozi translations, commentaries, and summaries:
Yutang Lin
  * still the best, by far. poetic and well-translated.
Robert Eno
  * provides a good summary and a solid literal translation, within contemporary English grammar
Derek Lin
  * provides good commentary and a solid literal translation, better than older translations
  
### translations of Epictetus
Oldfather / George Long / Wikisource
  * literal, good to use as the main source, as for words that may not translate well, he provides the simple concept.
White
  * my favorite, maintaining literal words yet cutting the repetitive grammar structure (this may originally been intended to be a speech), resulting in something more poetic!
  * “I have tried to translate the Handbook, in Oldfather's text, into a fairly straightforward sort of English, while staying quite close to the wording and phraseology of the Greek.”
  * the intro is great too.
Dobbin
  * most modern, shortest (in length), but also most interpreted (by him), zero poetics because his vocabulary is far more precise. It’s probably possible to read and understand this the quickest.

### The Taoism Reader
[2 stars]
This is indeed a “reader” aka a “source-book”, as in it’s just source texts with a short intro. Of note: it may be the smallest source-book I’ve ever encountered, which is quite fitting for the topic. The problems then are simply limited to the translation and the selections.

The Translation:
Bad. Zero poetics. No alternative words or concepts provided (neither as foot-notes nor in-text). So, like most silly Western-minded people, he decides to choose one word, and that word simply is not enough to convey the real meaning of the word, especially in each context. If this dude were given the task to translate the name of a restaurant, say “a homely restaurant” or “a restaurant with a homely atmosphere”, his translations might be “happy family restaurant”, “joyous family restaurant”, or even “emotion family restaurant”. Which is lovely, for the tacky names of American-Chinese restaurants, but certainly nowhere near good enough for something as important as the natural way of living.

The Selections:
A few sections from Laozi and maybe two chapters from Zhuangzi make up 15% of the text. The rest are texts from “Inner Meaning” and “Ancestor” Lu.

Lu tries to describe Daoist concepts more straight-forwardly in sequential form while pointing at problems of philosophy (the idea is cool), but often at the cost of adding more bullshit (energy, vitality, spirit, and so on). Can skim through it (and the rest of the book too...). Like Thomas’s translation, there are zero poetics here too. And even worse, it /feels/ as if Thomas translated Lu here(!), though he really just chose someone else’s similarly bad translation. So, all of the translation problems seamlessly continue.

Inner Meaning.


## The Art of Not Being Governed by James C. Scott
[3-4 stars]

Though the topic is very much of my interest:—who are the autonomous dwellers in the mountains of Southeast Asia, and how do they persist(?)—and though written clearly and straight-forwardly, he’s still a white dude sitting in an elite school.

Being a school-dude, he argues. He has to make an argument for it to be school “work”. Instead of stating some observations, thoughts, theories, everything is in the form of an argument. In being forced to argue, his argument fails, and even worse, it’s fucking written in the perspective of the state!!! (Fear of not being paid elite school money perhaps?... Anarchist card revoked!)

So, instead of people just tryna’ live and get by without being a slave, a prostitute (or just being a ‘woman’ in SE Asia; probably not mentioned), without paying rent (strangely he only mentions taxes and labor, not bureaucracy or other authority problems), getting away from discriminations (all of them), and, you know, all of the real problems by the wild governments (all incredibly corrupt and fucked up), to him, all decisions are of some /planned/ strategy. Great. State-evasion techniques! Farming, houses, and even society all consciously /chosen/ and /designed/ to evade the state!...Right. Apparently surviving and raising a family in the mountains (without a nearby hospital) is such a breeze there’s no need to mention every-day livelihood.

Another problem of academic-ness is that everything is written to argue against past academic people. Argh! So, he has to repeatedly correct the even more stupid past academicians, whom write of “ethnic peoples”, or in ancient academic talk, “barbarians”, as opposed to, you know, people. It’s as if he just discovered that people can be very different... This might happen if you spend your life reading histories written by people from Western states... If he had just /listened/ to the people in the hills and mountains, he could have actually learned something. But, alas, there’s probably not even an informal conversation with a real person in the giant book.

Yet another problem is that he repeats his concepts throughout the entirety of the book. He’s only got a few, but since those ideas have be argued for, they are repeated repeatedly. You will not forget ‘padi-state’ or ‘shattered-states’, or even existing concepts like swidden agriculture and corvee labor. Expect no creativity. Written in such a way, *all you really need to read is the conclusion* (unless, you too are an arguing person. Oh no!).

Just venting. I actually think the book is still really good to catch the giant picture of the stealth war between civilization (states) and natural-living peoples, between oppressive empires and autonomous villages. It also has some good insights here and there. And as I mentioned, it’s written quite okay too, perhaps too concept-oriented and dense for some, surely too tactical-determined for many, but I like it.

His more recent book (perhaps his last?), /Against the Grain/, is extremely similar to this one, except in that the subject are the first states ever, and therefore, and way more interestingly, the birth of /the systems/. Though this (/Art.../) is sorta considered his main book, I think /Against the Grain/ was what he was slowly working toward all of his isolated little life. At least it forced him to use some creativity(!), as there’s not much evidence to work with... Thus also providing a better reason to argue.


## Silent Spring by Rachel Carson
I read a few chapters a few days ago.

The first chapter felt like the intro of a sci-fi movie. Animals are mysteriously dying. Lands are blighting over. Nobody knows why... But, it eventually works out well, continuing to write this way for the beginning of each chapter, because, the truth actually does feel fictional.

This book came out much before I was born. So, reading this now, is...interesting. What I feel is that anyone who grew up after-ward kind of got a far more condensed version of the main idea through other arts and media, say, a Studio Ghibli film.

...Yet, I don’t really remember any art or media really able to /drive/ the Gaia idea (holism, ecology)—that, affecting one part affects the whole—into me as this book did.

I think it has more to do with the medium than anything. You really have to be alone reading this, to really digest the reality of it. That, synthetic poisons are blanketed via airplanes over much of the industrialized farms (or just places where the government sorta-randomly decides) carelessly. Poisons that seep into the ground-water or nearby streams. Nearby streams going into lakes or oceans, and, ground-water it-self being the under-land ocean...

See? It didn’t work. We know that already. It doesn’t change us. In animation form the point doesn’t penetrate the thick heads of people who grow up in cities (most of us). So, the book, with its info on each poison, real cases, some scary cases, the time spent with it, the whole experience really is necessary to really /get it/, to really feel the reality of what’s going on.

The experience of reading it reminds me of another holistic (though more dense) approach to an impossibly complex subject: Jane Jacobs on urban planning. Both of these women have to start with the description of concepts / patterns and then build up from there. It takes time, time to digest, time to affect.

Both books provide ways of seeing / a lens to the world. And it leaves me with the feeling that not only are females the ones that usually /get it/, but they’re also the only ones to be able to extract some truth about complex systems. Both of them accomplished it by completing their grand projects, by backing their intuitive insights (hunches, theories) up with a ton of real cases so that one can only believe them. And, all of that, with /style/!

...And, all of that, without computers too!

Inspiring to the insight-creating part of me. I’ve got insights but I would never fathom trying to prove them to the narrow academic / science world. These two surely greatly altered and sacrificed their own lives for the sake of merely trying to influence an alteration of the path of the capitalist-science-industrial system. Unfortunately, the system including its ‘development’ proceeded its same course, and even worse, scaled up, to the whole world!

## Revolution at Point Zero by Silvia Federici
[4 stars]

This is the first writings of Silvia I’ve read. So, I can’t judge weather this compiles her best works or not...

I read the first two essays, then, the first two categorized under ~international (globalization...). The first two essays are alright, on house-work and sexuality for women living in very normative conditions: capitalism, married to a husband that works 9-5, sex on the weekends, n’ so on. One has to take the context that it was written in the 70s, which is up to 20 years before me. Were all women merely house-wives in the 70s? So, maybe it was very radical then? Anyway, two solid essays from a house-working partner’s perspective within capitalism.

Then, in section two, there’s a much much larger context and project, of trying to make sense of what’s happening in the rest of the world. Here, she sounds like a female Graeber, seeing the big economic neo-liberalism picture (IMF & World Bank policies), but with more emphasis and empathy for all of the women that are now keeping us alive through their farming and factory work, the more self-reliant rebelling ones, and the more exploited ones. There’s a few good insights in here, and I too very much empathize for the same people most of my life, but, for me, her reasoning is too economic-determined.

The writer took a break from her school in a developed country to do some contract wage labor in Nigeria, and it /feels/ like it’s just that. I get the feeling she never really /lived/ like a Nigerian. Understandably, it’s impossible...to transform into one completely. Yet, I then get the feeling that she went back to her university, read a few books, then wrote these essays, trying to make sense of it all, favoring economic reasoning. The result is that it lacks much of every-day realities—not being able to obtain work, the struggle of providing for one’s self—vending food on the street markets, hot weather, repairing one’s home—the problems of Western education being exported, and, well, the everything other than economic stuff: the mind of a person who grew up in such a culture and environment. It almost feels as if she believes all women are the same: a good, hard-working mother. I guess that’s the con of trying to get the big picture, one skips all the details... Still, there’s bits of enlightenment here and there.

Overall it seems what she has in mind is the ideal of a self-reliant female on her own land getting by with subsistence farming, and, opposing her is the ‘neoliberal’-capital system; First, taking her land, then, using her body. It’s the positive ideal of the female (the natural way of life) versus the negative ideal of the male (the capital way of life), realized. And, I agree. That /is/ what’s happening! ...but how it happens is infinitely complex. Decent attempts though! Institutionalized, not poetic, but surely better than the minds that most schools meld. At least it never turns into some obscure shit.

One day I’ll return for the third section, but, I’m way more interested in her other work, /Caliban.../.

## The Stranger by Albert Camus
[not interested]

Warning to philosophers and other concept-oriented artists: though short, this still reads like a standard story. His non-fiction essays, /The Myth of Sisyphus/ and /The Rebel/, are what you are looking for.

Holy moly. Are some people really this detached from reality, their moment in time and space? This pessimistic? This down? If personality theory is true, perhaps up to 5% of the entire population?

Or was it to describe the emotion-less state after a death?

The experience of reading this reminds me of a life-less Brit more so, but, perhaps any cold, rainy European city could manufacture such a life-less mind...

Anyway, after listening to a good amount, I’ve put it down. Such lengthy fictions aren’t my thing.

I tried it because it often comes up recommended for philosophy, especially ‘continental philosophy’, but, I think his essays was what I was really looking for, not this dreary outlook on life.

## The Rebel by Albert Camus
[no rating]

This is massive, powerful, idea-oriented, but, restricted to a context, therefore, ‘causing  me to be un-interested in a topic I’m most interested in. I’m quite conflicted.

It’s very much, a seemingly common problem of French writers, in the context of a narrow set of canonized books and artists (Leautremont, Sade, n’ so on) during the time he wrote and lived. So, /the Western canon/ is referenced through-out, used as examples. And so, it suffers from a looping trap: to really understand much one would have to understand everything that is referenced. Thus, in order to read this today, you’d probably have to constantly use Wikipedia to get the gist of things, and actually read the referenced things to really get the grip of things.

It’s a pity, because his writing style admirable. He consistently writes with such straight-forward-ness and authority about rather deep human feelings! It’s something I can’t imagine being able to do, ever. I believe it’s a difference in our personalities.

It’s a further pity because the topics are nearly spot on with what I desire: rebellion through art, rebellion through action, what is rebellion?, anarchy, discontent with civilization and/or humanity, comparisons and unifications of it all. I don’t even mind talks about ‘avante-garde’ artists (Surrealists, Dadaists...), Marx, and a few others. But, the amount of references used just kept throwing me off...

Anyway, I began reading it for two reasons: the topic, and because it’s supposedly something the personality of my oft best friends in life might read. You know, those profound and loving /existential/ besties. If this is the kind of stuff they actually read at a young age...well, god-damn! I might not know my best friends at all!

The lesson: avoid referencing.

## Wittgenstein’s Nephew
From the first quarter of this quick read:

First, a note for those interested: this is not a philosophical fiction like /Invisible Cities/ or Borges, or even a non-fiction philosophy. /Keep moving./ (I picked it up for this reason.)

This is something very similar to Rousseau’s /Reveries.../, in that it’s a person who’s been socially isolated for some-time, near the end of his life, probably can’t move much or has become routinized, and, began writing. Writing often happens like that.

It is also like /Reveries.../ in that the person just wrote what was in their mind, non-stop, and in this case, without a line break! Surprisingly, I quite like the mind-out-pouring format.

The problem is that whereas Rousseau whimsically intended to write about his own feelings, humbly, in the process un-covering some insights about him-self, ‘the public’, human relations, society, and so on, this guy un-covers nothing.

I haven’t checked his bio, but, by reading this you’ll quickly get to peek into the mind of a stereotype academic elite from Vienna [Austria] who enjoys classical music, opera, and impractical philosophy.

If his wife were to write one sentence it could be much better than this entire thing. Instead, she was by his side the entire time he was in the hospital. And while I was listening to the book, I was mostly pondering how women could tolerate such narrow-minded people.

Then I was wondering why such a thing could ever be published. The answer: the publisher is just as narrow-minded as the author.

Ugh. I need to stick to reality.
—

After reading a bit more, it becomes a bit more congenial, mostly just wanting to see his friend as he lays in fear of death: his own and his friend’s.

But, meh.

## Calling All Heroes: A Manual for Taking Power: A Novel
[not interested]
I really want to give this 1 star for such a mis-leading title from the publisher, but, alas, I’ll merely mark it as ‘not interested’. Anyway, this is not a manual / hand-book, or even a novel! It’s something for people with nostalgia of the anarchic times in the 70s, a very niche product.

## Radical Self-Defense Manual
[not interested]
Warning: This is a pop-entertainment book for hipsters. Do not come for anything useful. The title is fucking mis-leading, which is surely a problem for anyone who orders digitally, which is, likely anyone that doesn’t live in Oakland.
