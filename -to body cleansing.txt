to body cleansing:

body:

soaps:
coconut-oil base, various natural plant oils, Vitamin E (acetate?)
  - $1
  - the rice-bran one is really good, smooth

scrubs:
designs:
scrunched ball design
  - un-folds easily, can also break if really thin
  - can’t reach back

small towel design
  - reaches back, versatile
  - used by East Asian cultures, especially Korea, Japan, and to a lesser extant, Taiwan

materials:
plastic
  - great at generating soap suds
  - can come apart easily, even break, leaving plastic to go into the drains

cotton threaded mesh
  - a good alternative to a rag
  - seems like it wouldn’t be as durable as a rag, eventually coming apart much like the plastic scrubbers

luffa
  - natural, good for occasional hard scrubbing

micro-fiber cloth
  - very soft, probably not scrubbing at all, but very great at lathering the body with soap suds!

rag
  - this is great for towel-baths
  - has a good amount of scrubbing power
  - extremely durable


lotions:
bees-wax based, various natural plant oils, Vitamin E
  - $1 for a tub of 500g


hair:
shampoo:
local natural stuff
  - $1

conditioner:
local natural stuff
  - $1

soft brush to massage the scalp (and brush hair)
  - wide bristles allow for easy cleaning / less crap accumulation
