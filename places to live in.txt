Important to see migration policies: which country politically and culturally acccepts migrants; That is, which countries have a green card (permanent resident with freedom to work) and culturally does not judge you before hiring.

Although one could get money from Japan and Korea, they aren’t places to make good social relations. Although Taiwan is all-around great, tolerant of non-Taiwanese, there is no way to work with society without a work visa, and furthermore, their work culture is terrible: judging you immensely before working together.

Thus, it simply leaves the younger accepting countries: America, Australia, and Canada. Culturally boring, yes, but, accepting, willing to work together.

My choice would be between America and Australia, simply due to warmer weather. Specifically, NorCal, and generally the west coast. Perhaps the same with Australia, choosing Western Australia towns over the developed south.

—
Korea
  - **money** ($2300-2700 + apartment)
  - racist
  - worst weather
  - good, modern city

Japan
  - expensive to move, even with a subway (and travel)
  - impossibly insular

China
  - Shanghai seems okay, worked best for the poster

**Taiwan**
  - **<3**
  - $1700-2000
  - warm weather
  - Chinese language
  - 
Thailand
  - **developing feel**
  - no modern fun
  - worst working conditions
  - Thai is still a difficult language

Myanmar
  - bad internet
  - least developed nation

conclusion:
most countries can be done for a short period of time, but only Taiwan seems like a long-term solution, a place to call home.

aim for SF alternatives

"provincial"
small town feel
old architecture, age, history

City, lowest-highest degrees fahrenheit, density (in the city), area size of city, area size of metro

1. SF, 58-71, 6632/km2, 600km2, 9128km2, + dry + windy, clear sky, creative careers
2. Auckland - 58-74, 57% New Zealand, 15% Pacific Islander, 19% Asian, 11% Maori, 1200/km2, 1000km urban
  - Wellington?
2. Melbourne - 56-78, 5% british, 2% Italian, 1.5% Vietnamese, 1.5% Chinese, 1.5% New Zealand, Greeks, South African 1500/km2, SF vibe in many ways
?. Sydney - 17% asian, 2000 km/2
*. Tokyo - 2200km2, 5900/km2 - learn japanese!
?. Vancouver, 43-71, 5039/km2, 115km2, 2,878km2  - 1/6th the size of SF?, 35% british, 27% east asian, 10% south asian, 6.5% french, more
?. Montreal - 4400/km2, 365km2, also a good choice?
x. Singapore - 7000/km2, 700km2, too businessy

Berlin* - sounds like it has a great arts scene, very Brooklyn like DIY culture
Stockholm - perfect to retire?


X. Toronto, 30-80, 2000 sunshine hours. 1800km2, 4000km/2, seems like the New York of Canada, also has similarly bad weather
?. Portland - 78% white, 7% asian, 6% black, 8.8% hispanic, 8% other
?. Honolulu - 50% asian - too small, not enough schools and jobs
x. LA - 68-83 + dry, car, 3000+ sunshine hours, 1200km2, 3100/km2, has a sprawl city structure
x. Chicago - 45% white, 33% black, 29% hispanic, ew
x. Amsterdam - 90% white
x. London - white > brown > black > others, ew

Suzhou?


New Orleans, has a SF small-town hobo vibe to it
Seattle?
Quebec City?

other western European cities I'm not interested in:

not very interested in East Europe despite high standards:
Prague, Vienna, St. Petersburg

towns and small cities:
1) Venice
2) Brugge
3) Salzburg

the general consesus for candadian cities is:
Vancouver is like SF - smaller area, creative careers, mild climate, more outdoor activities, greener area, more asian
Toronto is like NY - larger area, business careers, varying climate, less outdoor activities, better night life
Montreal - more french, more night life, more european overall, more sleezy

for Ireland:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland#Society
  - Ireland ranks fifth in the world in terms of gender equality.[172] In 2011, Ireland was ranked the most charitable country in Europe, and second most charitable in the world
  - Ireland became the first country in the world to introduce an environmental levy for plastic shopping bags in 2002 and a public smoking ban in 2004.

for Netherlands:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands:
    - With a population density of 407 people per km² – 500 if water is excluded – the Netherlands is a very densely populated country for its size. Only Bangladesh, South Korea, and Taiwan have both a larger population and a higher population density. Nevertheless, the Netherlands is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products, after the United States.[14][15] This is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate.

  - http://unlockingkiki.com/icelandic-fairytale/
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland#Transport
    - Iceland has a high level of car ownership per capita; with a car for every 1.5 inhabitants; it is the main form of transport.[126] Iceland has 13,034 km (8,099 mi) of administered roads, of which 4,617 km (2,869 mi) are paved and 8,338 km (5,181 mi) are not. A great number of roads remain unpaved, mostly little-used rural roads. The road speed limits are 50 km/h (31 mph) in towns, 80 km/h (50 mph) on gravel country roads and 90 km/h (56 mph) on hard-surfaced roads.[127] Iceland currently has no railways.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland#Cuisine
    - Much of Iceland's cuisine is based on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little to no utilization of herbs or spices. Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food.
