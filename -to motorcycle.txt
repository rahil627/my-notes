to my motorcycle:

Kawasaki GTO:

model:
gto m8xxx

perhaps a kh110 (not kh125)
  - carburetor same between kh110 and ar125 (the ar125 has the power ranger front cover)

carburetor:
  - need parts, Mikuni vmXX, not sure of model
  - not the same as gto m4

to fix / maintain:
- carb’ adjusted to rev’ too much on idle, ‘causing the motorcycle to move on neutral (whether it’s in neutral gear or the clutch is simply being held in)
  - that doesn’t make sense. when the clutch is being held in, it should’nt move the motorcycle!

- all cable lines suck during the rain, getting stuck and squeaking

- **the clutch cable can surely be more smooth with a better cable**

- **battery may be the reason why the horn doesn’t work, turning lights don’t work, *and* why the lights are so weak!**

- crap in the fuel tank can “plug” the carb’?
  - added a fuel filter
  - should just clean the fuel tank one night

- there’s something floating in-side the oil tank. Is that the oil level sensor?
