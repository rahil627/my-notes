care of material belongings:
use a clean tape for repairs: electric tape, tenacious tape vs kenyon tape
  - can use for anything: tent, hard-shell, sleeping bag, headphones, bicycle seat, etc.

to wash my fake Mammut jacket:
zip all zippers, fasten all fasteners, etc.
turn inside out
use liquid detergent
don't use fabric softener
dry outside
if need to re-waterproof: tumble dry for 5 minutes or iron

to clean my Enlightened sleeping bag:
It's a long process to actually clean it. For temporary cleaning just wipe with a cloth. Dirt, grease, is all bad, and if it's stuck, it can seep through the sleeping bag? Which then requires deep cleaning. So just try to lightly clean. Also wear clothes (including socks!) when sleeping inside of it, to avoid body oils going in.

how to load a backpack:
http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/loading-backpack.html:
  - Heavier items should be centered in your pack—not too high, not too low. The goal is to create a predictable, comfortable center of gravity. Heavy items too low cause a pack to feel saggy. Too high and the load might feel tippy.
  - Wrap softer, lower-weight items around the weightier items to prevent heavier pieces from shifting. What items are these? Your tent body, rainfly, an insulation layer, a rain jacket. These items can help stabilize the core and fill empty spaces.
  - Stash frequently used items within easy reach. This includes your map, compass, GPS, sunscreen, sunglasses, headlamp, bug spray, first-aid kit, snacks, rain gear, packcover, toilet paper and sanitation trowel. Place them in the pack's top pocket or other external pocket, if one exists. Some packs even offer tiny pockets on the hipbelt.

Ideally, a well-loaded pack will:
Feel balanced when resting on your hips.
Feel cohesive, a whole unit, with nothing shifting or swaying inside.
Feel stable and predictable as you walk, at one with your upper body.

Tent poles: If your pack offers elasticized side pockets, place the poles down one side of the pack, behind one or more compression straps, with one end of the poles in the pocket.
Trekking poles: Same deal; just put the grips in the pocket and the tip pointing upward.
Other tools: Some packs offer a series of external stitched loops called a daisy chain. Use it to clip or tie small items on your pack.

Note: Minimize the amount of gear you attach to your pack's exterior. External items can potentially get snagged on brush in areas of dense vegetation. Too much external gear could also jeopardize your stability.

http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/loading-your-camping-backpack.html:
Internal frame backpacks have a streamlined shape because the frame, a flexible one, is inside the backpack. Because the pack is flexible and carries close to the body, it offers a comfortable fit, a low center of gravity, flexibility, and a relative freedom of movement to the user.

Those features make internal frame packs good for rock scrambling, off-trail work, winter ski touring, and mountaineering. The drawback with internal frames is that they do not carry unwieldy loads easily and can become quite unstable and uncomfortable if you end up lashing large amounts of gear to the outside of the pack.

External frame backpacks feature rigid, rectangular frames that are usually made of alluminum. The weight carries higher than a pack with an internal frame, so correct loading is essential. The frame carries the pack away from your back, improving ventilation and making the pack a cooler choice. Because the pack frame is somewhat rigid, however, it tends to restrict moment.

External frame packs also typically have a higher center of gravity, making them feel a bit top-heavy unless you load them properly. External frame backpacks are ideal for very large and bulky loads and for long backpacking trips.


loading:
Loading your external frame pack
Use these guidelines to ensure that your backpack is properly loaded before you take off through the wilderness:

Load heavy gear like stoves, water bottles, and tents to the top and against the frame of the pack — near your shoulders.
Midweight gear like clothing and pots should take up the middle space.
Load the lightest gear to the outside and toward the bottom of the pack. Your sleeping bag goes under the pack.
A woman needs to load her pack with the weight lower and the sleeping bag attached at the top (because a woman carries her center of gravity lower than a man).

Loading your internal frame pack
Make sure that your internal frame pack is loaded correctly for your comfort and safety. When you load your pack, build from the sleeping bag on up, keeping heavy items close to the back of the pack (against the framesheet). Middleweight items need to occupy the middle of the pack with light items nesting to the outer edges and top of the pack.

alpine packs:
http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Mountaineering-Backpack-Reviews/Buying-Advice:

intended for use both hiking (on approach) and while climbing technical terrain

Generally speaking, and alpine climbing packs may sacrifice hiking comfort and frame support for increased climbing performance.
