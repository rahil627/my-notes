https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Country_Index
  - maybe the most accurate source compared to my personal experience, because it looks at behavior and policies

http://www.greatfamilyescape.com/10-countries-where-camping-can-be-totally-free/
  - countries that allow people to camp freely (“wild camping”)

http://www.wired.com/2015/06/copenhagenize-worlds-most-bike-friendly-cities/
  - bikability

to live in / end destinations:
1. Taiwan
2. Netherlands (and Belgium (Antwerp at #9 bikable and Denmark (Copenhagen #1 bikable nearby)
  - small and dense like Taiwan, but colder and more developed
  - free legal camp sites (!!!)
  - 3 cities in top 5 bikable cities list!
  - proximity to Denmark and Belgium
3. New Zealand
  - warmer weather, nearly entirely campable
3. Ireland
  - Dublin is bikable
*. Scandinavia
  - too cold? Expensive?
*. Japan
  - camping friendly, nature friendly, but expensive otherwise
?. Morocco
  - sounds nice


travel:
anywhere, but easier to camp in warm, dry weather

camping?:
http://www.bustle.com/articles/23324-the-25-best-places-to-go-camping-around-the-world-because-we-want-to-go-to
  - camping in parks is not as important as camping in the wild

old:
Berlin, Germany
  - people go to clubs to actually listen to the music, very artsy, like Brooklyn
  - go to music festivals! Especially Fusion.
  - #12 for most bikable, perhaps the most bikable huge city

South Korea
  - people are more direct
  - "Koreans are like everybody, I mean just mostly nice people but it is difficult for them to see outside the box sometimes. Especially with people over 20 yo"
  - "they drink themselves to death, smoke like shit, and work 12 hours a day 6 days a week"
  - "but if you can spend time with koreans after work you will have a lot of fun"
  - todo (from a Korean university student):
    - sorasan national park
    - Seoul
      -  complete Korea experience
    - soo chung
    - DMZ
    - not much else
    - Gwangju, an artist city

Thailand
  - cheap life, good food, could retire here with a profitable independent job
  - likely no art

Australia and New Zealand
  - expensive (like UK or US)
  - plain food
  - good scuba diving
  - not much reason to go here

Japan
  - plain food, not very tasty, but still interesting
  - most places are boring (according to Tomo)
  - go to Kyoto to see temples and architecture
  - go to Tokyo to see a mass of people looking down, like slaves
  - interesting anthropology
    - indirect people
  - interesting because of how nature is handled with care

India
  - can live here for free forever
  - can lead other people to make something great
  - can learn Gujarati and Hindi
  - tons of people, not sure how to handle problems, especially income inequality and corruption

Taiwan
  - a great mix of East and West, organized and efficient like the East, yet open-minded like the West
  - friendly people, like the kind-hearted people of San Francisco, relaxed, selfless, happy
  - no xenophobia
  - $13 hostel, $1-2 small meal or snack, $2-3 meal from buffet trays
  - can learn Mandarin

Hong Kong
  - mix of East and West
  - speaks English, and can learn Cantonese and Mandarin
  - expensive
  - todo:
    - stay at Chungking Mansions
  - just an expensive shopping center, like Singapore
    - little to no art
    - business-oriented

Singapore
  - seems too business-oriented
  - can receive the same culture (food, people, religion, etc.) from Malaysia for 1/4 the price. People are a little more ambitious than in Malaysia, but they still consume and waste; I'm unsure why people think the city is so clean. I'm sure Taiwan and Japan are much cleaner and more organized because the people are so.
  - little to no art
  - very small, only space for business and tourist attraction, limited like San Francisco

China
  - people are more direct and dirtier
    - sounds like Indians
  - a different level of income, must eat noodles and work in factories
    - interesting to see the labor end affects of global capitalism

Cambodia/Laos/Myanmar/Bhutan
  - Cambodia is stuck in the 1950's, extremely interesting
  - no electricity
  - valuable sustainable development and orphanage work
  - Myanmar is #2 for Lonely Planet 2012
    - very very poor according to the few films I saw. People do anything for a little money. Likely have to go to other countries to get money.
  - Bhutan is #6 for Lonely Planet 2012

Vietnam
  - eh? Not sure.

Malaysia
  - $3 hostel, $1.50 for a small meal, $3 for a set meal
  - delicious food
  - diverse
  - no contemporary art
  - lots of culture
  - people are more unhappy fearful, tired, closed, unwilling to help, angry when bothered
  - similar to Thailand in terms of cost and safety?

Philippines
  - cheap, but corrupted
  - a mix of tourist areas, undeveloped areas, and shitty cities

Indonesia
  - similar to Philippines?

Brunei
  - oil-rich

Papua New Guinea
  - interesting to see stone age humans, but likely more developed now

Bangladesh
  - like India, except more corrupted

Bhutan
  - buddhist heaven?

Nepal
  - great mountain people
    - feel like helping and being a part of society because the people are so nice, yet poor
  - yummy and healthy food

Pakistan
  - Indians probably shouldn't go

Sri Lanka
  - like India?
