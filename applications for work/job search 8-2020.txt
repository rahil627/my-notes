simplyhired
  - general catch-all aggregate job site with a good design, especially for tablets!
  - has remote-only option
  - can find anything, including rare ‘interactive art’ jobs

remote:
**remoteok.io**
  - very simple ‘n cute site, mostly startups, and mostly all-remote companies!
  - can use their remote.dev site profile as a short resume
  - mostly trendy web development startups; not very creative, nor do they sound fun. Only ‘customer support’ and ‘support engineer’ sounds okay.

ratracerebellion.com
  - list of web-sites that pay people to do tasks remotely
    - meh, it feels like the whole world would be competing for these simple tasks, need to specialize.

games:
gamedevjobs.io
  - has tags for remote and temp
  - https://gamedevjobs.io/tags/remote-temp/
gamasutra
  - very few, better to subscribe to e-mail, mostly corporate, but easy to go through as big companies cannot spam posts for multiple positions
gamejobs.co
  - very cool search filter system, but, mostly corporate

tech:
stack overflow jobs
  - not many remote, and those that exist are really lame
