##### Independent Filmmaker
beginning from December 2013  
Since my high school and college education is derived from films, I've always wanted to make some. It usually fights with my gamemaking interests. One of my intentional ideas was to make films while I travelled through Southeast Asia. It turned out to be quite difficult to feasibily create anything as good as the films I saw while growing up, but I did end up making a short film about a roti delivery man in Penang, Malaysia. Like game-making, I think film-making will always be a part of my life.
