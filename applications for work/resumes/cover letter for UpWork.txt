Heyyo.

I’ve never heard of ontology being used in anything beyond philosophy, so, as the person with a conceptual philosopher mind, first principles ‘n all, this was a bit intriguing.

I skimmed the wiki about it, but it digresses too much. My guess of what the heck this entails is that it’s simply a problem of language: the internet is based on keywords, very limited keywords that doesn’t translate the infinite complexities of life, which is why the visual part (youtube, instagram, emoticons) excels, and the written part of the internet fails.

It seems pretty interesting, but I’d have to understand more of it.

For example, the core problem of hiring me is that a I’m jack-of-all-trades sort of person. Artists do everything, but people that hire only look at specializations, list names of tools, etc. The most powerful people then can’t work with “professionals”, yet, they (the artists) make entire products from scratch all the time.

So, what would be my position? A “generalist” programmer, a “customer success representative”, a “community manager”, a “technical artist”, a “product designer”, “a community organizer”, “a volunteer worker”... or: just a person that listens to people, is fond of good designs, enjoys living and working within communities, used to make indie games and art games installations, busks music, and video-documents her mom’s cooking.

Anyway, in the meantime, I’ll check it out and try UpWork. But I’m afraid it suffers from all of those entrenched traditional problems of communication between business-institutionalized minds and uninstitionalized children.

Just a thought!

I hope UpWork isn’t limited to the English language...
