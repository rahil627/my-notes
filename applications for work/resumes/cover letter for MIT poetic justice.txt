1. art for justice; personal expressions containing desires and/or intentions of betterment of society, particularly greater equality / fairness and good / righteousness

According to this definition, k-dot’s music is a form of poetic justice! :) *pooooetic justice, whatchya whatchya want?*

2. karmic retribution

Although i deeply value physical / direct love and care for all people, plants, and animals nearby over mediated forms of care, i unfortunately have a personality that naturally constantly ideates artful tech solutions for big picture social problems, and, with just a few peers, have the abilities to make them too. Yeah, it’s a terrible condition.

I am alone here with this rather complex ‘Western’ rational mind-set. All of my friends are lovely mindful, tradition-carrying, seasonal-living, ecology-loving, feeling-driven simple Asian people. Nobody here can join me on this path, so I wish to join you (still from here though! I can’t ditch my friends!!).

Poetic justice might just satisfy my natural desire for doing what I believe is morally good (justice) and *necessary*, while making use of my natural skills in design and aesthetic (poetics), in addition to my childhood skills in tech. Most importantly, the use of media and technology can affect more people than without (this is a rare moment of utilitarianism/ quantitiveness for me). I cannot promise of being too poetic, but as long as there’s a practical potential of justice beneath, I’d be down. I hope my philosopher-like aesthetics will suffice.

Being born in American suburbia where I grew up in the 90s with computers (AIM, chat rooms, game mods, StarCraft map-maker, Spider-man Comic Maker(?)...) and video games, living in two American cities in which I seeked out and at times participated in as much meaningful (to me) art events as I could, then living in less civilized areas of Asia trying to care for others whilst learning about the world (without technology), and then finally living the ideal life within great ultra-sensitive eco-feminist communes in rural Asia (without technology)... It’s all there: all the experietial education needed to commit important poetic justice.

I could design and make tech things (tools and art experiences) to aid in the deinstitutionalization / diversification of the social construction of people in hopes of decreasing homogenization / increasing sensitivity, awareness, inclusivity, broad-mindedness [‘critical theory practice’?]. Sorry, that came out like garbage... And/or: I could create tech things to assist us in understanding each other, cooperating, building our own worlds, helping us maintain them, becoming, becoming closer, remembering how to be a child, uniting, loving [grassroots community-building]. That came out better! :)

I’ll have to ponder on the limits of media’s ability to really ‘cause justice some more...

1. rural-dwelling feminine people, for being ethical models of the right way to live. (To me they are extremely creative with their live-in-the-moment life-styles, as mothers must for survival; They are DIY masters and Daoist sorceresses.)
2. 李子柒（Liziqi) for living and recording the dream life
2. idealist back-to-nature animation directors (Isao Takahata), for providing directions for civilized cultures of people toward better ways to live and depicting / imagining ideal ways to live
3. street performers and artists, for directly affecting and interacting with the public every-day
* Brandon Stanton, for finding a way to remind us every-day that everyone is beautiful and human, have often lived complex lives, and are vastly interesting; and, that it’s okay to truly interact with anyone
* Vincent Moon, for simply video documenting the infinite ways human cultures have gone (and therefore can go): for documenting human potentiality [by himself]
* Banksy and other graffiti-like artists, for providing a way to continuously affect people

They are also important because they did it by themselves (except Takahata).

...Yeah, not really ‘technologists’, but **I value technique over technology, morals over innovation, content over aesthetic, and def direct actions over content.**

my favorites:
*. dream-pop music, for shifting attention away from distractions and toward our own innate directions
* Japanese role-playing video games (JRPGs), for creating alternate worlds for suburban-born confined children like the child me to explore, play, grow, and *be* in
1. playground games and interactive / game installations in public places, for their ability to create true experiences / moments through play, and more simply, for their touchy playful child-like fun :) [sensors, Kinect]
2. performances in public places, because experiences with people are more potent than experiences without (subjective?...)
3. non-performance art in public places, to constantly reveal true reality hidden beneath the material real world in order to maintain awareness / consiousness

the mediums that come naturally for me:
0. essays, ‘cause it’s extremely convenient, quick to transmit and consume (unless dyslexic like the young me), yet still potent (for experienced people) and flexible, though least accessible [ink ‘n paper, iOS writing app]
1. “game essays” a la Jason Rohrer’s early games, ‘cause it’s the secret medium of my childhood, hidden behind game-play, preceding films and writings, preceding languages, and therefore I feel the most potent, universal / accessible, and closest to real experiences: it is ‘art as experience’ [FlashPunk, minimalist 2D game engines with good openGL access]
2. “film essays” a la Chris Marker, ‘cause it comes closest to my own mind’s way of expressing, and the truth. Greater if it can be done without verbal language (I haven’t seen one without...). [iPhone, Final Cut]

others:
* video, for providing the only source of mediated truth / history
* smart-phone apps, for providing digital tools and the internet for nearly everything to nearly everyone in the world (save un-civilized areas, the poor, the disabled...)
* organized medias (meta-media?: indie exhibits, zines...), for providing ways for people outside the insitutions to curate, collect, and distribute ‘real’ content

一。 能盛行 (Factory in Tainan, TW)
二。 藝文樓 (Place of Arts in Pingdong, TW)
三。Babycastles (in NYC).

others:
*. an un-titled group of friends (Malaysia)
*. Tak Cheong Lane Collective / So Boring (HK)
*. an un-titled group of friends that went back to nature (Japan)

Those are the three communities / communes I was part of. Surely there are other nice, sensitive, caring, nature-loving, grassroots, DIY, feminists groups out there in the world, but those were the ones in my life-time. Nothing is more important than living right (vegan, zero plastic, zero waste, etc.), caring for all surrounding life, all the while slowly living and learning, finding one’s own life, together! :)

The other three are affinity-groups I’ve also lived with, but have crucial differences with.

note: of them all, only Babycastles contained digital tech art, specifically game art; The rest are “creative” by innovating new direct actions and DIY projects, without media.

Because you probably never experienced those community groups, I’d guess the following aren’t too bad, considering the constraints of being in NYC: By Us For Us (BUFU) & Yellow Jackets Collective; Silent Barn, various vegetable markets and multi-ethnic communities in Sunset Park and Flushing; School of Poetic Computation; Parson’s D(&Art)&T; Eyebeam.

I personally don’t remember experiencing anything too important made by ‘creative tech artists’ especially the more fine artsy ones during my short time living in hip parts of American cities. Maybe you can catch me up on the past decade? For me, although they had innovative mediums, they just didn’t come close to the crucial and vast content that older mediums, particularly film and writing, have, which I had conveniently experienced during my childhood. There’s unique potentials in new mediums and art forms, and I still believe in games, but it takes time.

if my own past ideas can be considered:
* a left-over food sharing and distribution (to those that need) app, especially for bakeries and farmers that waste tons of non-marketable foods
* a new craigslist
* an AR app that augments and maps media (old photos...) to your current real location (to see / build history)
* an app that allows you to create and participate in civil discussions about places, mapping place to civic media
* a fee-less money transfer app for migrant workers (e-currency)
* surely there’s some cheap way to prevent ‘roadkill’...? cameras? sensors? :(

if not, my forced answer?:
* the more playful game exhibitions at Babycastles that resulted in strange, uncomfortable, *unforgettable* often physical moments of play: games wih tactile materials atop sensors, games with wearable sensors, party ‘n play-ground games, etc.
* the more cultural game exhibitions at Babycastles that showcased video games made by varied minds (Black American, Chinese, Arabic...), and therefore showcasing the diversity / difference of human minds
* Zack Gage attempts to curate poetics from the vast social media

[optional:] my not-so-“creative” tech answer:
* crowd-funding, for enabling people to do what they truly want
* YouTube, for enabling people to upload nearly anything without filter, even if it defies certain institutions, showing truth
* blog software, for enabling people to conveniently express themselves on the internet and provide ‘one’s own room’ / home, digitally
* 8tracks, for enabling people to curate (music) ...a multi-media equivalent of this is another grand idea of mine: we could all curate our own “comparative studies” course, and share them

...Basically anything that enables people to ...live, *truly* live...and create!

* Justin’s project about the paths people often traverse. This is pure poetry for trapped wanderers. :)
1. Justin’s more serious street view projects. One seemingly adds a sense of reality to something rather detached *and* reveals / decrypts rather hidden data *in addition to* subverting / doing justice (Wiki edits); That’s 3 excellent ways for justice! Another seems to create a photo history of capitalist urban development / a history of enclosures...! Please give him more tools!
2. the refugee migrations history map. Though, to do this project real justice, it would need to link real street videos to each event: videos of people moving, massive camps, genocides, to really visualize it. My first motorcycle trip was to the Thailand-Myanmar border; It is the strongest memory of my early Asia nomadism. I am stuck in Thailand at the moment, living with maids from Myanmar in a ‘project’-like building, and I’ve *just* recently looked into “the longest civil war.” Side-story: Just last month I *finally* saw YouTube videos of Idi Amin’s time (my Indian mom was born in Ghana)... Perhaps one could map a history of all human migrations since the beginning thus creating the *Sapiens* of digital history?

I’m personally against the more ‘fine art’ projects for obvious reasons (accessibility); The goal audience should be the average Nigerian, right? At least the average Black American or Taiwanese cultured person.

I’m also personally against one-way-communication (‘traditional?’) mediums for obvious reasons too. All of PJ’s projects could be/become tools that people use to create and share online... *I* want to map the enclosures of my friends’ families natural lands and watch and drink in sorrow with them. *I* want to wander around Iceland! :) :) Participation, interaction, and community are near requirements for me, with the exception of rare deep poetic experiences.

I’m more into what practical ways can behaviors of people consistently be altered  for the better? What profound, life-changing experiences are possible through media? In what ways can awareness and emphathy be reminded, every-day, every moment?

I don’t mean to be critical to Ikene, and sorry if he ever reads that and felt so. Difference is magnificent. My commune-organizing partner is a poetic, artsy, fine-taste-enjoying loving dreamer. I’m just a bit more... pragmatic-minded, I guess. Let’s make tools for everyone!, not just art for no one. Though, exploring new paths (forms of art, media, tech) has a place in history too...

The way that his arts usually have meaning (the rates of things) reminds me of the way game mechanics have meaning in the more poetic games that I personally liked during suburban high-school. I just dont know how anyone could have intuitively figured out those meanings (rates)... :/

...Shit. You’ve provoked the art critic in me. He’s a beautiful person!! Let’s not argue about differences.

civic media, poverty action lab (“prototype, test, scale what works” attitude), the one with the guy that made Makey Makey before it got consumed by Scratch, the one with better sensor / input tech (tangible media?), games for change, maybe data feminism

My bad for submitting so many times. The whole application often resets upon opening on my iPad mini, making it impossible to copy-paste.

I answered the questions off the top, without research (save glancing at Poetic Justice’s projects). Pardon me if I wasn’t too particular with names / titles.

My entire application is quite strange [to me] because much of the questions provoked answers that come from experiences 7+ years ago. Since then, I’ve rarely consumed any media, save music and DIY videos. To simplify explaining, let’s say I’ve been living a thoughtful indigenous life-style: living in the moment, reacting to and interacting with immediate environment. I used media as a child as a way to learn, but that was it’s only use to me.

It seems like the poetic justice group is seeking new forms of art. That’s cool... I used to be into aesthetics before I was 15 too, but an innate practical and moral drive made me leave aesthetics (as an end) soon after. Given that I spend time with current tools ‘n tech with the Lab, naturally I’ll use them to concept and make stuff, resulting in new forms, just as I did or desired long ago via public art and new media art in city spaces, art game situations with Babycastles, and earlier poetic games with experimental indie game makers. I am experimental by nature, but... I guess I just hope that this isn’t purely an aesthetic, fine art path: justice *before* poetics!... tools that enable before art.

Lastly, I wish to work remotely, from a place that I can call home, near the mountains in south-east Asia, where there still is much potent diversity, in all forms of life. This is what keeps me inclusive, striving for universality, always thinking about the lives around me. I would not feel at home anywhere else. I think Ikene can empathize. Can justice even exist out-side the places where people call home? Poetic justice can’t. I know it. He knows it: It needs real communities; It needs true life: It starts from home!

Please allow me to work with MIT so that I can save a little money in order to invest / insure the livelihoods in/of great traditional feminine individuals that I’ve spent my life seeking, so that they in turn are able to take greater care of the world around them in each of their own unique ways. They, by virtue of living a caring life, cannot save money. Allow me to do it for them, at least until I am able to re-unite with them.


cut:
The way that his arts usually have meaning (the rate of incarceration, HIV, rent affordability, etc.) reminds me of the way game mechanics have meaning in the poetic games that I personally liked in suburbia. The difference is: in games, the meaning is intuitively understood through play. I am not sure how anyone could have figured out those meanings (rates) in his arts without somone or something explaining them... and... if the art has to be explained... can it be considered a success? :( Shit. Now you’ve provoked the art critic in me. He’s surely a beautiful person!!

Please allow me to work with you, so that I can save a little money in order to invest in great traditional feminine individuals that I’ve encountred in my life-time, so that in turn they are able to take greater care of the world around them in their own unique grassrooted ways, and perhaps repair their old Mitsubishi vans that they live in, and insure us for when civilization’s police behave like bureaucratic machines or for when civilization’s transportation machines crash into us (our homes and family). They, by virtue of caring at every moment, cannot save money. Allow me to do it for them, at least until I am able to re-unite with them.

* an installation that transmits audio from popular busking locations to other public spaces

not-so-tech:
?. morally serious public performances (forms of direct action)
?. public music performances (busking), to throw people off their habitual routined lives
?. whoever projected “99%” on a building beyond the Brooklyn(?) bridge during the Occupy [NY] protests

?. the deeply human films by Hirokazu Koreeda, Ozu, and others
?. the more “anthropological” slow films by Jia Zhangke and others

?. the Humans of New York project
?. the more “ethnographic” documentation (his Planetes...(?) project) videos by Vincent Moon

If I were disabled from directly caring for the people, plants, and animals nearby, my natural desire to physically care would then become mediated: to care for the world through non-physical / in-direct ways. One such way could be through poetics: poetic care.
—

perhaps I can guess some groups in NY that I might share some values with: By Us For Us (BUFU) along with the Yellow Jackets Collective seems to have had an excellent month of feminist events at one point in time; School of Poetic Computation may have been the best possible school for me back when it first opened, far better than any standard institution, where you can really seek, pursue, explore, grow, share, and be one’s own unique self, somewhat close to life in communities,...but still not a true community, since it wasn’t voluntary or donation-based

I’m personally against the ‘fine arts’ projects as only extremely institutionalized minds in privileged museums can access and feel them.

* the ethnic filter one | didn’t work on my iPad... but it might be cool to have an app that realistically alters the skin color of people in photos. It could be quite a profound experience to see your own friends, family, heroes with altered skins. Better yet: do it in real time with a smart-phone camera!! (this is MIT...) The prejudices local to me here in Asia are completely ethnic-based too.

(I think Ikene can empathize: if you were to take him away from the streets and homely communities where he resides (yet again), and throw him into a lifelessly top-down designed campus, it would alienate and deprive him.
—

I believe that MIT Media Lab is extremely smart and self-aware of it’s own homogenous and institutionalizing culture, and understands that people must be able to live their own lives in their own ways in their own places, not surrounded by a similarly homogenous and civilized American city, but, in the make-shift natural and rural homes we all used to make on our own.
