Do whatever is necessary. Take care of everyone around me.

I started making games driven by a desire to express myself (through games). Two complete small flash games later, I changed direction toward playing with gameplay systems to find something fun. Another two more small flash games later, I stuck to making simple party multiplayer games that my friends and I grew up on and looked back to.

Later, I stumbled upon a unique punk ethos DIY ethic game art group in NYC, and we did anything and everything to express our love for the art of games. This involved: setting up game art installations (made arcade cabinets , put indie game in them, then “exhibit” them in various places around NY), running game jam events, supporting local indie game makers (show & tell events, topic-based discussions, meet-ups), shoving them into the arses of giant museums...

Throughout life, some form of game-making happens every now and then, but since this time period, I just play a consultant / philosopher / friend role.
