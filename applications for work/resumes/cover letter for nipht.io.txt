Heyo. I hope this area fits a letter?

Anyway, I’m applying because I’m just a bit curious of the product, and, of course, if I really believe in the product, then, I might be able to happily work on it. If the idea is to have everyone gather reads (and other expressive mediums) from the entire internet, inclusive to all languages (and non-verbal cultures?), then be able to sift through these somehow (keywords, categories, moods?, feelings?), then this could be interesting to me. To be able to find good writings hidden in blogs, conversations in public instant messaging places is much needed in the heavily institutionalized digital world, where the non-social-media part of the internet mostly consists of business-minded crap.

I’m definitely not a senior-level programmer. I mostly just did it [programming] for artistic reasons in my past. But, I don’t mind crafting and then tinkering on a single product that I truly believe in, as it can lead me to have a tidy feeling of having a well-designed product.

Welp, surely that’s enough for this tiny space! So long!
