for a crowd-funding site

Yoyo. So I’m here, in Chiang Mai city center, quarantined. The hot season has ended and now it’s hot season again. Thai isn’t my cup of tea, but, if this can be done remotely in the future, this might work. I normally live in Taiwan, sooo it’s not too far is it? I mayyyyy be living here for a bit, depending on the mountain winds, Immigration’s mood, etc.

I haven’t done programming in ages, but, this position sparked some possibility because it’s reminiscent to to my first programming job, a whole decade ago, which was the only non-game-programming that was enjoyable, precisely because the main part of the product was made using the .NET framework (C#, LINQtoSQL?, .ASP, fancy lambda magic, etc.), keeping the core of it really, really neat. Otherwise, I’m honestly not really a tech person. If I want to make something I just do it, and in my past, those things I wanted to make required some coding, often some form of digital art work.

I also dig the idea of crowd-funding, in the bigger picture. So there’s that too. More-so monthly-income style than project-based, but, all are better than ancient institutionalized ways of financing anyway. If Taiwan needed such a site, that would be fantastic. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the cultures here...yet? This place is chaos. :( Surely the good rural hearts will show through though...

I’ll be heading off to the mountains in search of a private bungalow on Saturday and then some self-sufficient communities on my motorcycle, or earlier depending on weather. Also, all I’ve got is my iPad mini... so... I might have to use some bullshit until I fetch an old Macbook.

Anyway, I hope I’m not talking to myself.
