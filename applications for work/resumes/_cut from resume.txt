The Northern Europeans narcissistic, with a superiority complex, lacking cultural sensitivity, loveless. The Thais following plight similar to the native peoples of Taiwan: addicted to alcohol, kratom (like coca leaf), and contemporary technologies. 

Tired from the lack of love I decided to go against my own natural will [to care] ‘n opted to just let them be, mostly ignoring them. I just don’t care about such toxic cultures ‘n peoples, and I don’t even feel like pondering nor philosophizing that moral choice.

from traditional cook in chiang mai:
People here seek Bhudda to escape(!), not for the good-hearted ethical or spiritual reasoning Taiwanese people revere Buddha for.
