Herro. I’m **Rahil**, and *this* is my resume. I tried to limit it to experiences that are valuable to others (regardless of economy) and whose length is at least one month. My portfolio at **rahilpatel.com** goes beyond those artificial boundaries. You can email me at **rahil627@gmail.com** or message me at **m.me/rahil627**.

##### me at home in nature
now  
Back to money, then, back to me: hopefully, creating my own utopian community, with hippie income models (all donation-based busking, natural food and drink vending, crafting, etc.) and personal digital projects (crowd-funding-based media). East Coast American values on the East-side of Taiwan. This should be the end for me.

##### poverty in a place where one doesn’t belong
now, and whenever else I ran out of money  
Unfortunately, Taiwan has a severely stereotype-based, politically-correct, superficial, passive education and therefore culture (much like the West Coast of America, but without welfare), leaving me in poverty, facing high discrimination. Lots, lots, lots of time wasted trying to make even a single social contract for wage labor. Motivation (need?) to become money-minded and independent, get the fuck out of the South, set up shop, and make sure that I or anyone never experiences that again. (Did labor work, volunteered and ate at a Bhuddist free-meal-serving kitchen, gifted money to others in the trap). Lost faith in humanity, especially of the South-western strand of Taiwanese culture.

##### Regular at 能盛行 (“The Factory”) in 台南市，台灣
January to February in 2018 plus major events  
*The* community of Taiwan was closing down, so I headed south (again) towards the sun to it, to give and take what I can, before I venture on my own. A very traditional life: simple daily habits, motherly love, festivals, material awareness, emotional awareness, and other forgotten ancient values. Particularly good at living with other utopian-minded, peasant-minded, pure-hearted people. Very group-oriented, clique’ish even, in thought and action, which made real individual participation impossible (though still much loved!). Being nearly entirely female and nearly all from nearby villages, they were quite sensitive and keen to structural violence, power relations, etc. in social relations and in capitalist-development. The absolute opposite of my personality and culture, but, the traditional female is a mystery of eternal mystery!

##### Resident Core Volunteer at 藝文樓 (Place of Arts) in 屏東市，台灣
January to June 2017  
The second great community of my life. Coop[erative] living and doing. Projects included: event-making (hippie stuff: all donation-based music shows, vegan potlucks, crafting workshops, spiritual performances, natural markets, etc.), experimental rooftop gardening, collecting and eating un-sellable vegetables and fruits of local farmers, motorcycle maintenance, stray animal care, stray human care, music-making, musical-instrument-making, drinking expired alcohol, making too-fermented fruit alcohol.

##### Resident at a hostel in 宜蘭縣，台灣
5+? months in winter 2015-2016  
A homely experience surrounded by rice paddies. The simple, thoughtful, country-side ideal life...in an unbearable climate.

##### Designer Cat and Programmer Cat at Catlard in 高雄市，台灣
from May to July 2014  
I co-designed and co-programmed an augmented reality application with Simon (aka Catlard) for a very uncreative business contract. I don't know how Simon tolerated me during my travel-high, but it brought back some fond memories of childhood game culture and New York game-making culture, which was lacking during the previous year of nomadic life.

##### Independent Philosopher
beginning from at least March 2014  
After a long period of travel and using another human language, I happened to stumble upon the Western philosophy section of a library, and then I attempted to write everything that I knew. All of my early philosophy is available through my portfolio.

##### Resident at JV’s Hostel in 台北市，台灣
5 summer months in 2013  
Part capitalist, part community; mostly individualist: something that served as a stepping-stone to later, more egalitarian forms of community. A great compromise for the best location in the city. (Also the highest rated hostel in the country during my time there.) Humans of Taiwan project (see portfolio).

##### well-intentioned Traveler in Asia
beginning from October 2012  
While living nomadically, I sometimes am able to create social contracts, exchanging my intentions for a place to sleep and eat. This includes: friends, CouchSurfing hosts, social organizations, and wherever else I happen to sleep in. Notable social organizations include: a couple-run support org for refugees near the Burmese border in Thailand, a great group of city artists (direct and indirect action for sex worker and land issues) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and a volunteer organization that re-builds destroyed houses and schools for aboriginals in Taiwan. Sometimes, just a little passion is enough for exchange. Applying the gift economy is more meaningful than capitalist wage labour, but manic-inducing, as one must constantly find a way that fits and pleases the constraints of others’ values.

##### Exchange Worker at 達達美語補習班 (Dada School) in 中壢，台灣 (Taiwan)
from August to September 2012  
This was my first gig during travel. One of the things I wanted to do while traveling was to try things that I value more than private sector work, in this case, raising kids.

It was a work exchange at an independent school (more of a daycare) run by a fantastic couple: John and Ching. I helped out wherever needed. I did some general work: house chores, cooking, and babysitting. It felt like living with a family that was strangely forced to teach and learn English. I had wished I had done more, a lot more. Perhaps it was the heat and humidity (no air conditioner), or the mosquitoes at night, or Ching's delicious food, or the lack of creativity in the minds of everyone. Still, I managed to stay until my visa nearly ran out.

##### Volunteer Cat at Babycastles in Brooklyn, NY
from January to February 2012  
Ahhh my first love. Amazing people doing amazing things. It was specifically what I was interested in, but had no idea a community for it existed. It was what I was looking for all along. At the time I was just beginning to create things myself (game prototypes), figuring out what games are, what it means to be an artist, where fine art fits, and just being real. The things these people accomplished on a daily basis was unbelievable. I merely helped setup and facilitate art game installations, and helped (or worsened) with organizational development. I regret leaving New York because of these people, and I will come back, despite disliking the city.

The organization taught me everything: the possibilities of games, the possibilities of new media, social organizing for art with an emphasis on inclusion, event organization, working within a group of powerful equals, the infinite possibilities with social relationships within *the* city, and how to actualize dreams.

##### Intern at zdLLdz in Brooklyn, NY
from January to February 2012  
"Interning" with Zack. I "assisted” with a film shoot in the freezing cold and “researched” stereoscopy in film and games, though, in reality, I merely biked through dope NY communities to get to Zack's place, ate delicious local pizza, and hung out with the film gang at his apartment. Zack's ambitious, on the edge of technology with the eye of a child; Very inspiring.

##### Independent Gamemaker
beginning from September 2011  
I began making games, using Experimental Gameplay Project as a deadline. After many finished and unfinished prototypes, game jams, and collaborations, I eventually helped my friends in New York create *Crystal Brawl*, a local multiplayer sports game. Unfortunately, one other game remains unfinished: *Pinkies Up*, a local multiplayer multi-touch multi-iPad game, created with love with a great friend. I imagine game-making will be always be a part of my life. More detail in my portfolio.

##### QA and Release Engineer at Perfect World Entertainment in Foster City, CA
from February to May 2011  
From suburb to city, I picked up a new job too quickly, perhaps afraid of financial risk. I oversaw day-to-day tasks for the engineering department. The department creates and manages websites (and web servers) for a bunch of shitty Asian MMORPGs (except *Torchlight*). It was a cumbersome process in a large company. Unrealistic goals, constant overtime, hasty testing, shoving out “milestones”, pacifism toward authority; The stereotyped horrifically inefficient software company. I knew and warned that I was going to leave within the first week, but I stuck to the job because I was still absorbing the experience of living in a city (San Francisco). I tried to help the company as much as I could but I came to the conclusion that my slightly more ideal values were meaningless in a large company, and my desire for something more meaningful, or at least more meaningful than managing websites for lifeless games, made me leave, promising myself to never compromise for money again.

##### Software Developer at Segin Systems in Virginia Beach, VA
from February to October 2010  
My first "professional" job. I chiseled at their flagship web based real estate software. Most of the time was spent implementing interfaces to scrape data from ancient third party title software databases to be sent via web services. The rest of the time was spent extending the superbly coded web-site, written by the lead developer who made fine use of the then current .NET framework. An amazing, even ideal first programming job, as there were only two other developers, and most of the time was spent programming. I knew I was going to leave my hometown, but I thought it was best to have a little ”experience” before doing so.

##### Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA
from 2005 to 2009  
Schools are stupid. I think I just needed to get out of my parent's house, or a break after high school to allow myself to take self-directed action. I did, however, value the time I watched neorealism films (thanks to Netflix technology), listened to indie music (thanks to Napster technology) hung out with my friends, chatting about the world while playing competitive games.

##### Assistant of the Manager at LaQuinta Inn & Suites in Norfolk, VA
summer of 2008  
This is my dad's second hospitality business. Franchises have so many rules; It makes having fun impossible.

##### Temporary Manager at Village Motel in Chesapeake, VA
beginning from 2003  
This is my Dad's motel. It takes a surprising amount of civil engineering and hackery to maintain motels. I’m often here during the winter, when the manager takes a vacation.
