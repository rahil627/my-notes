Heyyo.

This sounds like a fun, chill job. :)

I used to be into making art games ‘n not-so-artsy indie games, so, if given access to the code, perhaps I could just go in and fix the problems myself? *googles Destiny game engine*, *reads about engine sucking so bad that it takes an entire day to move an ojbect*... perhaps it’s better to stick to testing, yeah?

I haven’t played either Destiny nor D2. I hope that’s not taken negatively. Perhaps it’s easier to start out fresh? I haven’t played a bungie game since Halo 3. Sorry Bungie. I’ve been out of gaming for a good decade...

Upon little research on the game, it seems to have gotten severe backlash for being bland... :( And so this cover letter becomes sadder...

Anyway, the only thing that sounds boring to me is the testing of the same thing several times across multiple systems. That’s the part of game dev I loathe, especially in the case of mobile devices, where anything could ‘cause a random hardware-related bug! I hope there’s not too much of that, and more so, of understading the game’s inner workings. Though, I guess it would be nice to know where specifically where each console hardware sucks so as to anticipate problems.

I’m very much a generalist. A person that like to understand everything, see the big picture, and shepard things along it’s own way. If you think there’s a space for that, this might work out!

If not, if it’s some sort of monotonous robotic top-down follow a todo list sort of experience, then, it likely won’t be for me.

I do indeed live in Taiwan, though at the moment I’m stuck in Thaialnd indefinitely. :/ (Hence the idea of working remotely!)

I hope that’s enough to determine if I am fit or not! No hard feelings either way. I hope the backlash didn’t destroy the souls of the people working there. I guess that’s the difference between indie devs and industry... you guys ‘n gals have some super high standards that your fans expect. That sucks! Hope you guys coped fine with that!
