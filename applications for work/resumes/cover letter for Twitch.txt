# hullo,

i’ve just recently settled into a hand-made wooden cabin next to nature—*wellll*, industrialized farms—, and, after a few days of restoring ‘n updating my childhood web-site, my mind has gone back to my childhood: of playing and making interactive stuff. I then naturally started getting back to organizing some old game-related projects. Then, upon watching a recent Melee^ match, i saw Twitch’s logo on Zain’s^ arm—another brown kid from VA, frighteningly similar to myself 15+ year ago, wayyyy before e-sports touched that game. And so the inceptional day-dream of working with a game *organizing* company began, and so did all of it’s possibilities... But i’m a dreamer, and businesses don’t want dreamers.., right?

# an example possibility (IGDB?)
One of the possible projects is a social discovery site for games, starting with Letterboxd as a base of what that should be like. Luckily, in high school, I was fortunate enough to have Netflix via mail-in DVDs, and so finding the films I loved relied on chance combined with internet research. Eventually I found my favs, but it took some time to get there: at the pace of the much loved postal workers. Fast-forward 15 years, to the pandemic, I re-watched a few of my favorite films, and, with Letterboxd, i found nearly all that i could ever want. It was incredible. Similarly, 8tracks (rip) allowed *people*—us!!—to hand-make playlists of music, grabbing music from all over the world and putting them together; the results were also incredible: playlists for every vibe or mood imaginable. Now, i don’t see why there isn’t something so dominate for games. Steam’s market-place sucked since it’s inception. It’s honestly just a one person job—see gg.app.

To me, finding great games is incredibly important. I was quite old when I played Braid. That single game alone led me to making (“indie”) games myself, at home, in the vacuous surburbs. Later, when I was in the New York game art scene, I got to experience a ton of game or game-like experiences which no one will ever know about. Perhaps they were made for an exhibition, during a game jam, or just at home and recently discoverd through a friend’s friend’s friend. For a long time now I’ve felt the need of a database ‘n social site that documented industry games *equally* along-side game mods, “maps” (was it not a StarCraft map-maker that made dota?), hacks, game jam games, indie games, etc. art games. It (the scope) can even be taken further to non-video games: table-top games, play-ground games (freeze tag), traditional games (kite fighting in India), etc. It’s a pretty grand lifelong game documentation endevour... but it goes hand-in-hand with the Letterboxd-like social discovery ‘n 8tracks-like playlist-making parts: for *you cannot discover without a place to discover works, and you cannot have a good database without people constantly socially discovering and adding new works*.

The only problem with this idea is that i *hate* web development.., but who knows, I just made like 6 different web-sites with GitHub Pages ‘n Jekyll, so, maybe things are slightly better than 10 years ago?.. It would surely test my love for games... but that’s why I like the idea of working with a big company. I’m hoping there are multiple projects ‘n tasks to do. You know, take breaks ‘n take time to listen to the people (“user-voice”) ‘n answer requests (customer support), or do something similarly social, lively.

# personal directions (it’s okay to tl;dr this)
The Letterboxd-like game site is just a single idea. I’ve personally had long interests in experimental games (especially non-video physical ones!) and fighting games. I wonder how Twitch can help people, like me, that have similarly niche-interests. Unfortunately, only pure love ‘n passion can feed the experimental game makers; Only they can organize themselves... But it’s quite surprising to me that the design development of competitive games (including fighting games) is pretty non-existent, especially now that e-sports has blown up. When i was in NYC, NYU had an incubator program ‘n maybe an archive (of games), but that’s about it... :/ I feel that people who love experimental game, fighting games, or any other niche games don’t really have a solid singular global place to go to, to share their niche passions with, to cooperate, to hang out, to live life passionately. It’s just completely separate groups of kids around the world going alone on *really really* difficult paths (making a fighting game is not easy), with only the help of their own local-based digital spaces (chats, forums, etc.). Now, I’d never want to alienate nor destroy a (grass)roots community nor a group of friends nor their local digital spaces, but, at the least, i think they could benefit from some higher-level digital organization here: info, resources, digital spaces, networking.., beyond their own local resources. **It would be really rad if Twitch could just serve as a singular place for all kinds of narrow-interested people and bring some of them together, even if it’s just for the sake of coming together.** The internet is mess: reddit is garbage, Discord seems fantastic, but is kinda anarchic.. Surely more can be done here... Truly beautiful things often happen when such disparate people come together. I believe it’s these kids that really know what makes a game *good* or *fun*. In fact, I might just believe they are the future of games. It just saddens me that they must go on their own and DIY their way through everything, especially for those, like me, grew up in an isolated suburban area... I just don’t think the smaller communities have the organizational power of as the Melee community does. The Melee community has the power to make fantastic “net-code” (the best?), hack big company controllers, make their own controllers, organize huge events, etc., etc. But, i think Melee is exceptional. Most other communities will dwindle, fall victim to isolation, extinguishing their passionate fires.

# gud-bye
Well, that’s enough dreaming for now... I think you understand me enough by now. If the company is good, I am interested in working possibly for a long term, *remotely*, from Thailand, then Taiwan, which is where I normally live. From age 4 to 23, I’ve lived ‘n loved video games, and grew up with friends whom are all gamers. My life during this past decade has been vastly different: in hippie ‘n indigenous ‘n permaculture groups scattered throughout Asia. This means I haven’t touched a company, software, or even an actual desktop OS for nearly a decade. I’m only just now finally reaching an intersectional point where I can have both of my loves: nature and games.

i don’t know what other positions there are because the web-site’s career page doesn’t work on my old iPad. When I tried to submit a ticket about it, a blank red box appeared on the top of the screen—i’m pretty sure it’s another error (see what i mean about web development? ;) ). Lastly, i tried to ask support on Twitter, no response, but i don’t blame them—they’re beyond busy!.

i’m unsure of the values of the people at Twitch—I’d probably ask Scar^—, but, as long as the company is doing their part of the job: being responsible and taking serious consideration of the next generations of gamers—*our children*—, and thinking about things like: *how* they experience games, *how they find* good non-psychologically-abusive games, how to share and translate their passions with their parents (especially first-generation immigrant parents like mine :) ); often listen to the people, and just be conscious, careful, inclusive, as many gaming communities are, then, i’m totally down! Gamers truly are some of the best people i’ve encountered in the world. :)

Currently my resume is as long as this cover letter, so I’ll try to condense it and publish it on my new site at rathewolf.com. It should contain links to my old site at rahilpatel.com/portfolio and rahilpatel.com/resume. Luckily making a handful of new simple ssg web-sitees wasn’t the end of the world...

fyi: My Chinese language (talking and reading/writing traditional characters) was great before the pandemic, but not sure now since I’ve been stuck out of Taiwan... My Gujarati language is only good enough to talk to my parents. :)

Within the next few weeks I must apply to teaching jobs in Taiwan, as the country is still soft-closed for the pandemic, and so working there is one of the only few options to get back home. :( Just e-mail back when you get a chance!
