# school?

## desired location? [1]
east side schools:
  - **DongHua (east valley, near Hualien City)**
  - x/Tzu Chi (Hualien City; Private, Medical College)
  - x/Fo Guang (Jiaoxi, Yilan; Private, Buddhist).

- the other schools seem terribly stupid supported by large religious foundations. But who knows? At least Tzu Chi seems survival / simple-living oriented, with its disaster relief. Probably the same for Fo Guang. That could feel much better than most wasteful American universities!
- DongHua may just be the best “comprehensive” college, after NTU an NCKU. But whereas those two schools are in the center of cities, [N]DHU is located in what may be my ideal environment: farms surrounded by natural mountains, and on the east side of Taiwan.

## application requirements? [2]
2017 Fall Term
Sep. 13, 2017 ~ Dec. 5, 2017
Jul. 14, 2017 with visa deadline
Aug. 14, 2017 without visa deadline

would need to look at scholarship deadlines[3]
HES and Taiwan (MOE and MOFA) scholarships both have Feb 1 - March 31 deadlines

other scholarships[4]:
NDHU Scholarship (B.S., M.S., Ph.D. )
  - Monthly living allowance- about NTD 6,000
   - lolol, slave wage
  - Research incentive: NT$ 8,000 per month (14,000NTD or ~$450-500 per month)
    - maybe okay with living allowance AND research incentive
NDHU Southward Scholarship
  - aimed at Southeast Asian alliance countries
  - Monthly living allowance- about NTD 4,000
    - lolol, no freedom

## interesting programs **merely by title**
Department of Arts and Creative Industries, MA, Chinese
  - studio module, for freedom, treat as The New School’s D&T program
?/Department of Taiwan and Regional Studies (basically area studies), MA, Chinese
  - maybe interesting? More literate?
?/International Master's Program in Asia-Pacific Area Studies, MA, 90%+ English
  - sounds lame, business and international relations oriented (economy and politics), but I checked NCCU’s not NDHU’s department
Humanity and Environmental Science Master Program, MA, 90%+ English (also Chinese, also a PH.D in Chinese)
  - also sounds a bit lame, not quite sure what they really do

## conclusion
The rewards are nearly worthless in comparison to a hippie’s lifestyle. The rewards are $20-30,000NTD per month, which is about the same as a hippie gets selling goods on the street or busking once per day. The hippie is free; The academian is not. Still, the Chinese language scholarship is still an okay choice, as long as one desires to study it [the Chinese language]. Attending a higher education program is probably a bad choice, as most programs suck, disabling much freedom. Furthermore, both **schools are location dependent, which limits body movement. The choice of the school is the choice of the environment [(including one’s peers)].**

**In the case of NDHU scholarships, the rewards are worthless, and one is nearly a slave to the school, having to maintain attendance, grades, being stuck in their environment, eating their food, on about $100 per month.** It is only possible to live with the research incentive, and perhaps be more free with a PH.D, or a studio-based art program.

1. So, just simply apply for the Chinese language scholarship, and see if there is a way to get around the writing requirement. If writing is necessary, fuck it.

2. Otherwise, a Taiwan Scholarship can be tried, but I read somewhere only two are granted (todo: should check the past winners. If given solely to “development”, fuck that too). Thus, one for arts may not be possible. The money from a Taiwan Scholarship and the freedom of the studio-module might be a good constraint.

Otherwise, be a hippie.
