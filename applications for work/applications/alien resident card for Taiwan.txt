APRC (Plum Blossom Card) (永久居留證 (梅花卡))

# other ARCs
the normal APRC has ridiculous requirements (must stay for 183 days per year, police records for the past 5 years, health certificate, must have twice the income of a standard Taiwanese?,), $10,000NT fee, and more bullshit

**the standard ARC has one good option: marriage. And a second one listed as letter G: “approval letter from authorized government agency.**

# documents required
the application form
  - the Taidong NIA said they use the same form

# extra documents (for extra points)
a photo?
copy of passport
  - can easily add copy of school cards too
copy of current ARC?
health certificate?
educational and work history
  - resume, portfolio (website)
    - need to update resume to include more recent experiences

# who to send to?
the Taidong NIA simply puts the package together to send to the Taipei NIA. So, it’s probably best to simply send it directly to **Taipei**.

“9.  Make an appointment with an NIA agent to submit your documents. Never, ever just try to walk in.  Always make an appointment via telephone first.

10.  It’s Interview Time! Ok, it’s the big day. Remember to bring two passport photos, all your documents, and copies of your documents, including your ARC, your old passports, and of course, your current passport.  The agent will go over all your documents and make sure everything is signed and in order before you submit them. They call it an interview, but it’s really just a document inspection process – no questions are asked, so you don’t have to worry! Once this is over, you need to sit back and wait. People have gotten their APRCs in as little as two weeks, but more commonly it takes closer to a month. Your letter of approval will be sent to your residence, but somebody has to be at home to accept it – you’ll need to sign for it. With approval in hand, you go back to the NIA, pay them $NT10,000 (except for Plum Blossom Applicants, as they are exempt) and then wait another two weeks, when you will return and pick up your newly-minted APRC.”

# how long does it take?
**there was one case where it took 6 months. Will have to check the other case. Anyway, it’s probably best to marry for the moment. Or, just do some more busking for the next two visa trips.**

# draft

[todo: can have old, pre-travel resume, and new, during and post-travel where I directly work with people, volunteer, organize, or act good (model behavior)]

## begin
This is the sole writing and document supplementing my application.

There are no reasons why a human should be restricted from living on a particular part of land on this planet; yet, this land’s state’s government somehow limits the reasons why, greedily according to their own (Western-influenced) desires: social “development”[1] and money (“economical development”[2]). Luckily, I have a history of both. (Unluckily for all the other good people that may desire to live on these lands.)

First, I will tell how I’ve helped Taiwanese people (“contributed to Taiwan”[1]). Second, I will tell of my (“professional, critical, rare, special, etc.”[2]) skills.

##
Over the past 7 years, I’ve never done wage labour here. Instead, I’ve only done real work, outside of the limits of corporate, government, higher education, and other capitalist institutions. This [work] involves directly helping people and (voluntarily) being a part of organizations that directly help people.

This is a list of the organizations I’ve volunteered at or co-organized:
- Dada elementary school; 2+ months
- 通化街鄰居 / Tonghua neighborhood in Taipei City; 6+ months
  - Fablab Taipei (and Taipei Hackerspace)
  - 九樓 /9th Floor
- a family in 東山，宜蘭縣; 4+ months
- a family in 東清，蘭嶼; 1 month
- Catlard (in 高雄市); 2+ months
- 能盛行工廠 / NSX Factory (in 台南), two events
- 屏東藝文嘍 / Pingdong Place of Arts; 6 months

Everywhere I am, I think of creative ways to help the people and environment around me. That is my work and what I’ve spent much of my life-time doing.


## end
There are many possibilities, but they are all made difficult by not having a working resident status: I cannot do contemporary work with any company (short-term freelance [art, design, tech]), I cannot transfer money between American and Taiwan (need ARC for online banking), and I must give my money and time to an airline corporations (90 day travel visa).

Many of my friends that live on this land also do real work: care for sex workers, migrant workers, and stray animals; educating people of food waste, plastic waste, cement and plastic manufacturing; and create sane environments to live in. They all understand this state’s government, like all other states’ governments, is stupid; but I am now questioning it through this writing: Are you stupid? Do you still want to treat me different from people with “citizen” status? Why? — Why do you still treat people differently? Why do you still call people without “citizen” status a “foreigner”? Why do you call people who work here without “citizen” status a “migrant worker”? How can your state educate people, telling them that America has racist problems and India has social hierarchy problems, when your state’s government institutionalizes both?

Humans that live on this land (with and without this state’s government’s desired skills[2]) will eventually leave because they have made it so difficult to live. A freedom to work is necessary [to sustain life]. Without that, entrepreneurship and innovative companies are impossible to create. Furthermore, without that, people’s fate are reduced to two choices, become slaves (for institutions) or hippies. Without freedom to work, I’ve chosen to stop innovating, and become a hippie.

I hope this writing reaches a human. If not, I may apply for a marriage visa; and the government will continue to remain stupid.

Either way, I must pay an airline corporation or your government to continue to stay here!

[todo: real work -> my work]




I am applying for either reason: (1) “special contribution…” or (2) “senior professional…”, and I’ll provide writings for both.

(1) My contributions to Taiwan mostly consist of being a voluntary member of organizations that I admire and a good civic individual.

I was part of Pingdong Place of Arts for 6 months, a volunteer for The Factory for certain events (same sex, ocean home, connecting with environmental organizations in other countries), Taipei Fablab,

  - “While I do not yet have the card in hand, I can certainly let you know what I included in my application. Along with the required documents (application form, health check documents, copies of passports and current ARC, etc), I also included details about my professional activities (I'm an associate professor in the humanities): education background, employment history, a list of publications, two distinctions I've received from Taiwan's National Science Council (the major research funding agency here), plus a university-level teaching award. I also included a short corroborative letter from the current section head of the National Science Council to back things up. The friendly agent at the Taipei Office, Mr Cheng, was skeptical that the Plum Blossom committee would entertain an application from a humanities researcher and educator--but it appears that it went through!”
