To whatever school Rahil applies to:

Rahil is a close friend of mine, one of the closest during college, and certainly the closest in New York (he was my roommie!).

He enabled me to go to New York. Without him, I doubt I would have gone. He has no fear of going into any sort of place and talking to any sort of people.

Even in New York, a place where crime is a major problem, he'd have no problem going to poorer neighborhoods, Hispanic neighborhoods, Jamaican neighborhoods, or wherever. He told me he used to live in a Chinatown in San Francisco, and probably would choose Brooklyn's Chinatown if he could. So I'm guessing that's how he ended up in Taiwan. Though I'm sure he'd be fine whenever he is.

He's a machine at work, and can equally play all night. He does not stop. And looking at his recent history, it seems he really never had stopped. I don't think he can stop.

That's the thing about Rahil: he has something that motivates him to keep doing stuff. He's talked to me about his perception of cultures in New York, his perception of excluded people (homeless), his love for cultural neighborhoods. He's seen all of the movies early on, and even read all of the books now. I'm guessing he's still interested in these things and that's why he applied to the program: to allow him to continue to do what he wants. He actually probably doesn't need the program, but I think he really excels in these kinds of social constraints, even if he despises all of it.

At least, that's my guess. He hasn't told me what he's been up to recently, but we all know he's doing good things wherever he is in the world. Isn't he in India now? To help people in the slums is in parent's hometown? Haha, only HE would, or even could!
