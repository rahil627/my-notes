I do not hand-­write Chinese, and am nearly unwilling to learn how to write; I could type it.

Furthermore, I doubt I'll have time to transcribe my autobiography by the application deadline. I don't even desire to do it, as it is meaningless because I wrote it in English first. If this is merely a test of my Chinese ability, then perhaps I can write something new, which would be more fun for me!

If it is possible to update this after the deadline, I will try to spend some time writing an essay in Chinese.
