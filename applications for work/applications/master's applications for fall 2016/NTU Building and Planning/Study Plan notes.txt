temp notes for Study Plan2:
Todo:
Missing how analysis works. Part of how science works in theory.

Missing how implementation works. How to organize people and institutions to take an action.

Missing from Technology: play with material (civil, crafts [wood, metal, electricity]), electronic (hardware (embedded, micro-controllers), mapping, software). Need workshops and jams.

Can look at MIT and TFD applications and use them for quotes.
  - books read list from MIT application
  - research requires too much time quote for the research paragraph
  - why I applied... and to experience... quotes from MIT application to how an academic institution can help section.

Study whatever that related to my practice and GIBP's practice. I've already read much theory and philosophy. I would rather learn how to practically go about proposing, or simply take action with personal wealth, public social art, etc.

About department choice: I will only apply to this department, although, my interest may include national development, public affairs, philosophy, and design, they all appear to be top-down, and do not provide much information on their websites or in their physical administration offices, giving an impression of ancient academia. In education I prefer to experience the practical and create the theory myself with self-study. Still, it may help to communicate with people from those departments. Yet, my focus is not to develop those departments, but to develop public spaces in the city, locally, communally.

Daily experiences, social and urban interventions within my locality. Then gain knowledge from NTU about things like local property, land use, current problems, etc. Small steps, small projects, experimental, like game prototyping, except for social and urban interventions.

bits taken out that contain school specific material:
from Theory:
I noticed that there are research centers that share certain old ideas found in some of my readings -- gender and space (critical geography, specifically gender geography), globalizing cities (cultural studies), new ruralism and development (ideal patterns a la A Pattern Language), and Urban Settlements and Landscapes (everyday life a la Critique of Everyday Life).
...
I noticed that the research centers use case studies the build theory from the reality. Although I'm glad that there is information, I am always skeptical of all information. I instead am interested in how to obtain academic resources efficiently (Google Scholar?). How do researchers research (reality and primary sources?). Are there people able to create anything meaningful, especially compared to a film documentary? How does that information lead to practical urban and social interventions? Or are most social philosophy journals privatized, forgotten, into some impractical abyss? I have no idea.

Cut:
As I mentioned in my autobiography, I began reading philosophy at age 26, beginning with a The Great Ideas of Philosophy lecture (and now audiobook) series and ending with The People, Place, and Space Reader (from CUNY graduate school). I will always self-study, but i
