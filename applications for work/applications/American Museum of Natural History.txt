My life's objective is this: I want people to feel that the world is 
playground.
I'm an extremely playful person, probably akin to one of the characters in On 
The Road.
I fucking love science museums, probably for the same reasons I love games 
and interactive museums: I'm an empiricist, I learn by play, and I try to 
make life and playful as possible, while learning and working.
I been to several: Exploratorium and Children's Creativity Museum in SF, I 
was volunteering at Babycastles during the Space Cruiser exhibition helping 
on install day and making a very poor website in an hour, NTT ICC and 
Miraikan in Japan, Nam Jun Paik in South Korea, and several interactive 
exhibits including The Carsten Holler Experience at the New Museum and The 
Creator's Project in SF.
Moreover, I've been traveling for the past year and half, rarely using 
technology, gravitating toward public art, real interaction in daily life, 
choosing to live in Taipei, which has a very street-oriented culture.
As of now, I am in India, taking a break from Taiwan. I currently plan to go 
back to Taiwan to teach and continue learning Chinese and continue with 
personal projects.
Unfortunately, perhaps the con of traveling in Asia, I haven't been 
programming much recently. My last game (Crystal Brawl, available to play at 
Silent Barn in Brooklyn) is made in a game engine that doesn't even require 
programming. I plan to make a Unity game this month, but I'm unsure I'd want 
to do it alone. I need to work with people. I plan to attend the Global Game 
Jam regardless of that.
I applied for NYU ITP and Parson's Design and Technology master's programs 
for Fall 2014 a few days ago.
If I do get this job. I'd gladly come back to New York, rejoice with 
Babycastles, and NYC's loving game development and interactive community.
