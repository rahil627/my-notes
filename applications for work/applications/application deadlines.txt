    - Full-time fellows will receive a stipend of $80,000 or $100,000, depending on work experience, seniority, and current income.
    - In addition to the stipend, fellows will receive a project budget. That budget may include expenses such as travel (including airfare and hotel), visa costs, part-time research assistance, conference fees and health insurance.

    - This is not a traditional grant or an academic proposal. Make your words leap off the page. We don’t need extensive citations, graphs or flowcharts. Rather, make your case in powerful and assertive language. 
    - Lastly, please run a spelling and grammar check on your proposal, and turn off “track
changes” if you have used it.

schools, detailed:

limit schools to free ones:
http://www.thecollegesolution.com/list-of-colleges-that-meet-100-of-financial-need/
  - mixed, some free for all, like Cooper Union, some free based no family income like most top colleges
  - Columbia is probably a good one that meets 100% and may have a program within my interests
  - UC Berkeley is not on the list, but may be good too

civic media and urban planning:
1. MIT Media Lab with Civic Media focus

Parson’s D&T
  - private design school, costs a lot

NYU ITP
  - public school, but still costs a lot

UCLA Design Arts

Caltech Social Science only has PH.d, the rest are hard sciences

resources:
https://www.quora.com/Which-schools-have-programs-similiar-to-MITs-Media-Lab

2. MIT Urban Studies and Planning:
  - not fully funded? Well, likely fully funded if I show that I have no income. Bases cost on parents? :(
  - emailed about applying in addition to MIT Media Lab
  - MIT city planning master’s program has a core master’s program, then one can choose a specialty from four things
  - MIT international development group
    - very similar to city planning, adding perhaps one economics and one spatial analysis
  - MIT city design and development (not a master’s program, but a set that cane be chosen)
    - perhaps the more theoretical, including David Lynch’s “mediated city” idea, design for “urban performance” (livability), transformation (re-use of material)
     - collaborates with media lab (same building). Need to read more, but afraid that it’s mostly focused on developed countries, as opposed to Taiwan.
  - Urban Information Systems “cross-cutting”
  - http://dusp.mit.edu/behavior-and-policies-2014
    - this class is super interesting
  - Christopher Alexander, Kevin A. Lynch, Processing developers, possible first video game developers
  - #1 according to planetizen (UC Berkeley at #2, and University of Illinois at #3)

3. NTU grad [urban] planning and building (architecture) - 02-33665855
  - December 23 - March 2 (January 26 early deadline)
  - international affairs: 886-2-3366-2007(#206 for master's), 886-2-2362-6801
NTUA new media - 886-2-2272-2181 ext. 2154

Sinica
  - political thought, 886-2-27898136, 886-2-2782-1693

4. TUDelft*
  - costs a lot for people out of the EU

UC Berkeley (and UCSF and UCSD)? Other UC? TUDelft*? University of Tokyo

meh:
x. New School city planning
  - design and urban ecologies, MS, real work*
  - x/theories of urban practice
  - x/transdiciplinary design MFA, close to D&T, more fun designs
    - theses are terrible, one is an okay idea, but a hackerspace jam idea at best
    - feels as childish as D&T. Though, neither emphasize theses, and are studio-based, so a lot of work can’t be seen in them. The problem of rich people designing for poor people occurs again.

later in life:

critical theory:

1. New School for Social Research
  - MA in liberal studies*, lol!? Amazing. School forever. Later in life.

1. European Graduate School
  - best school for critical theory or just a waste of money?
    - “It’s essentially a critical theory summer camp that will give you a Master’s degree for $20,000”
    - waste of money
    - http://forum.thegradcafe.com/topic/20496-european-graduate-school/
      - good two views
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/38j1hy/looking_for_phd_programmes_on_critical_theory_or/
      - now accredited with improved MA and PH.D programs

1. CUNY - environment psychology, human geography, etc.
1. Columbia
1. UC Berkeley - rhetoric, emphasis on critical theory

1?. UC Irvine
1?. Stanford - Modern Thought and Literature

2. Northwestern
2. Cornell

3. NYU Gallatin

x. UChicago Humanities Division’s Philosophy
  - UC’s urban planning seems and even written “data-driven”. Old like their economics. It’s more of a place to read history, write, and think of philosophy, a la Zizek. Something of the past. Really outdated.
  - John Dewey, George H. Mead, Hannah Arendt and Bertrand Russell
  - Graeber
  - current faculty are very old, with old ideas

http://forum.thegradcafe.com/topic/14586-good-programs-for-critical-theory-phd/
English and Comp Lit departments tend to have some theory-minded faculty, as do French and German departments. Sometimes sociology, anthropology and other social science departments have critical theorists.

      - graduate institute of public affairs
      - graduate institute of national development
      - department of sociology
      - all seem to be outdated or old compared to building and planning, whose philosophy is much more modern. These seem very academic as opposed to practical, experience, material ontology.
        - should ask Pan for his opinion
        - they also all just seem top-down oriented, government as opposed to capitalism.
        - should just go to NTU myself and check the departments. Inquire, wander, like I did at NCKU.
        - also costs $60 to apply for each department
  - cost of NTU is only $1500 per semester! Not bad.
