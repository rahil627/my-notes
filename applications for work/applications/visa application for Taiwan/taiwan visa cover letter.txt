Letter to Embassy Agent:

Enclosed is my application for a visitor's visa and the supplemental documents. Before reading through I'd like to inform you of my plan.

I plan to travel the world, slowly. I am hoping to stay in Taiwan for the maximum amount of time before going to the next country. I also want Taiwan to serve as a temporary hub for my travels in East Asia. I may go to Japan for a few months then return to Taiwan, go to Korea then return to Taiwan, etc. The arrival flight has been reserved and the departure flight is proposed. I can not purchase the ticket until I get my passport back.

Since I am trying to leave as soon as possible, the tickets may vary by a few days, depending on how long the visa takes to process. If all goes well, I will use the current reserved flight. As of now, the departure flight goes to Hong Kong, but I may want to change it to another nearby country. Of course, I'll book both simultaneously.

This is my proposed itinerary:
From United States to Taiwan on 8/13/12. A reservation from ANA is attached.
From Taiwan to Hong Kong on 10/09/12. An example flight is attached.

Please contact me if you have any problems.

Thanks,
Rahil
