  - because most private funding goes to nonprofit organizations, the individual grantseeker should expect to encounter even stiffer competition for grant dollars than the nonprofit organization. It is essential, therefore, that you research all potential funding sources within your own discipline or geographic area. Here are some basic rules of thumb concerning individual grantseeking.
  - If you are seeking help with funding your higher education, you should first contact the financial-aid office at the college or university you plan to attend. Direct financial assistance from the college, federal and state subsidized loans and grants, work-study programs, and support from local clubs, alumni, or religious groups are all possibilities.
  - Depending on the nature of your project, you might wish to consider affiliating with a tax-exempt organization to broaden your base of potential support. It is important that you begin looking for a fiscal sponsor at the same time that you start researching potential funders. Another option is to consider incorporating as a tax-exempt organization.

Heya,

I have a contradiction. I want to apply for a grant for the creation of a voluntary organization (a branch from another) that befits much of Wallace's themes, but, according to a webpage, must be registered 501c3 or equivalent is required.

1. Is it possible to apply without a registered organization, with the intention of creating one?

2. If I am a volunteer of tech and urban planning spaces, which may overlap civics, should I apply under those organizations instead?

Any help is helpful. I find individual grants (not awards) are near nonexistent, yet I am an individual who regularly participates in many organizations.

Hey.

I'd like to apply for a grant, but find myself in a interstitial situation:

I want to apply for a grant for the creation of a voluntary organization, which may share materials and people of existing organizations.

1. Is it possible to apply without a registered organization, with the intention of creating one?
2. If I am a volunteer of various tech, urban planning, and social spaces, which all overlap civics, would it be a good strategy (for the sake of securing grant) to cram the civic projects under one of the existing organizations?

Any help is helpful for very near future grant inquiries as I have always funded myself and am inexperienced in grants.

notes:
MacArthur Foundation:
Grantmaking takes account of these trends through a strategy that is framed around two fundamental aspects of human rights: free expression and criminal justice.  There is an emphasis on accountability as essential to securing human rights and a focus on leveraging technology to advance the work.
…
What MacArthur Funds:
Defending free expression includes attention to: responding to government pushback against human rights advocates; promoting political accountability; advancing Internet opennes.

Enhancing criminal justice focuses on: expanding national-level accountability for mass atrocities; and advancing criminal justice reform in selected countries.
