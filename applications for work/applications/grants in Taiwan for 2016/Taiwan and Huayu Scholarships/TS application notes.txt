TS application notes:

order of applications:
c/1. NTU
c/2. NCKU
  - for Tainan weather (提醒：學期從秋天開始）
x/3. NTUA
  - waive application fee?
  - similar to using D&T for social and urban ends, but might run into problem of people with solely media / higher class thoughts
    - yep, saw class, all stuck in computer lab, very computer and media heavy, even the professor, fine art is much broader in content and world view
　 - also when I asked about past student work, they did not allow it. One was quite impatient, narrowly organized. She gave me work from 2006? She said the 2012 work costs money. How awful. I was able to determine past work through posters on the floor above.
   - I asked the crafts department if other departments, such as new media were able to use their equipment, they first said no, then they asked if I knew, I said yes, then they still said no because of safety, I asked if I could sign an agreement, they said no. No flexibility.
4?. a school who's application is due after March 31?
5. TS (需要註冊大學）
  - email about references in sealed envelope


can apply to both MOE and HES, but can only choose one?
  - check if I can do HES then TS
    p/- still not sure

  - Call and ask about LEP and Huayu
    - MOE does not have LEP?
      - asked if I should check "no" on the application

  - Can do HES beginning in June-July vs July-August 
    - asked about taking both summer courses
      - can only choose one

  - Call and ask about MOST
    - check embassy website for MOST
      - sent email (to TS email) telling I was unable to find it, but I should thoroughly check
    - Can only choose one, compare with MOE

MOE's number: +886-2-7736-6666 (student affairs)

Must choose between MOE and HES
  - cannot do two scholarships simultaneously

  - not an ally, apply to MOE

  - call MOST

Money:
HES gives 25,000/month
  - lasts 9 months
  - may be able to begin class the previous summer, but I am not sure if they will begin paying at that time
TS gives 20,000/month (for post-graduate) + 40000/semester.
  lasts two years
  - includes summers and holidays
  - does not include application fees
they begin giving money at the beginning of school

NTU
  - 60,720/semester, first two years, then half for every year after that
  - estimate 84,000-113,000 per semester

NCKU
  - 56,500 per semester, extremely cheap living expenses
  - with TS can transfer school and/or department

NTUA
  - 12000 + 5000 per credit / semester
    - 15 credits*5000 = 75000, so at least 87,000
  - estimate 190,000 to 250,000 per year (living and personal expense too?)
