shampoo:

  - use on scalp
  - avoid circles
  - start with hot water to open cuticle, then end with cold close cuticles, but avoid scalding your scalp!
  - putting hot water on the scalp can make it really dry
  - **when the scalp is dry, the body reacts by making it’s own sort of oil-like substance** (hence my oily hair during winters)
  - **if you constantly dry out the scalp with shampoos or hot water, the body produces more of that oil-like substance**, thus you should not shampoo often

conditioner:

  - don’t use on scalp!
  - “Most people use conditioner after shampooing, so as often as you shampoo, you can also be using conditioner. In fact, **shampoo should be used less often than conditioner, as it is harsher on your scalp and hair oils, so you could choose to use conditioner more frequently than you use shampoo** (just be sure to rinse it out properly). It is important to choose a conditioner suited to your hair type for the best results and you only use small amounts evenly distributed through your hair to avoid buildup.“
  - “**The standard rinse-out hair conditioner for regular use is meant to be washed out within a few minutes of application and not left in your hair.** Leaving it in your hair provides no benefits but could increase oiliness/stickiness or weigh your hair down, making it appear limp and lifeless. Deep conditioners are also inappropriate to leave in for longer than the conditioning treatment instructions recommend. Leaving such conditioners in too long can make it hard to clean your hair properly and may cause an itchy scalp. There are leave-in hair conditioners purposefully made for leaving in your hair, which are much lighter than rinse-out or deep conditioners.”
  - “**Always condition your hair after you shampoo it to restore moisture, shine, and manageability.**”
