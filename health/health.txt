multivitamin tips:
	Stay away from iron. The body can't eliminate iron, so unless your doctor tells you otherwise, you shouldn't be consuming extra iron.
	Mix up the carotenoids. Beta carotene may be the best-known carotenoid, but it shouldn't be the only one in your multivitamin. Carotenoids are found in fruits and vegetables and are said to be necessary to the human diet. There should be at least some of the following in the multivitamin: beta carotene, alpha carotene, gamma carotene, lycopene, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin or astaxanthin.
	Check the type of Vitamin E. Dl-alpha-tocopherol is the least beneficial variety of Vitamin E and the most widely used. Look for a multivitamin with d-alpha-tocopherol (rather than "dl") or one with tocotrienols.
	Get plenty of Vitamin D. Studies suggests people should get about 2,000 international units a day of Vitamin D, but most multivitamins have only about 200 to 400 IU.
	Avoid calcium. Men shouldn't take a calcium supplement; Weil says it increases the risk of prostate cancer.

...just take the time to do the research one day. Should be 100% DV of essential vitamins, preferably from non-synthetic sources. Use the rest of the space for minerals, buy a different bottle every time.
