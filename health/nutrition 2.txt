avoid:
**milk tea, especially those sold on the street of Asia**, as they often use a combination of:
a chemical syrup (todo: wtf is this?) to substitute sugar
a chemical to substitute milk: powdered or liquid (10% milk, 5% palm olein oil, 0% butter-fat milk) and/or a thicker often sweetened condensed liquid (50% sugar 10-20% milk, 5% palm olein oil
a chemical to replace dairy creamer (mostly palm oil??)

otherwise, street tea without milk and sugar is fine: just bring your own sugar


tropical cooking oils: palm, coconut, etc.

white sugar
**white rice**
etc.

basically, just remember to fetch whole grains (brown rice, whole multi-grain breads...), and drink tea ‘n coffee without sugar ‘n milk

generally:
‘mediterranean diet’: this was taught to us as children through the ‘food pyramid’, with bread on the bottom and junk food on the top

protein:
avoid anything with high cholesterol
avoid large animals
small animals, especially fish
eggs

lentils
  - sweet lentils, green mung beans, red beans (2-3 kinds!), etc. things used in Taiwanese sweet soups
  - savory lentils, used in daals, cooked / infused into rice
nuts, nut butters
seeds, raw or roasted, whole or crushed
seed oils, some can be used to cook with (sunflower, sesame, canola?)

fats:
avoid anything with high cholesterol
aim for the ‘good’ ones: mono-saturated, not poly-saturated or trans)
seeds
seed oils
nuts, nut butter
fatty vegetables (avocados, ...? what else?)

eggs, mostly in the yolk
meats, mostly in the skin

carbs:
whole grains: whole rice (“brown”, black?), whole-grain breads (wheat, rye...), whole grain mixes (“muesli”: oats, barley, rye, seeds...)

omega 3:
basically: your body doesn’t make it; it must be consumed / taken in externally.

there are three compounds (molecules?):
ALA comes from seeds
EPA and DHA come from oily fish
DHA comes from algae

ALA is metabolized into EPA, then again(?) into DHA.

**humans ALA to EPA metabolism rate is tiny, perhaps 5%, so, fish, algae (other sources?) are necessary.**

so, if you cannot find fish, the easiest way is to buy a supplement (capsule), which usually contain all three compounds

sources:
‘oily fish’: especially small ones, such as anchovies, mackerel, etc.
seeds: flax, chia, basil...
avocado?
