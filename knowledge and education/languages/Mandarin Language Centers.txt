Chinese Culture University

"I would suggest that you choose a Mandarin training center somewhere that you would like to live. They are all basically the same. Personally, I would probably try Tzu Chi in Hualian or maybe one in Jiayi. The weather is terrible in Taipei and the cost of living is high. On the other hand, Taipei is the center of intellectual and cultural life in Taiwan and there may be more advanced classes at Tai-Da and Shi-Da."

You can always get a bad teacher too. That's what really matters.

Overevalutating the University. I need to manage time, not choose the best. Learn languages 3 hours a day. Don't stop. Keep living. You numskull. It's up to you, not the school. Less researching, more doing. YES. FUCKING COMPUTERS. STAY SOCIAL. MAKE EVERY HOUR COUNT.

Should be near city. That's all that matters. Shorten the commute. Keep working, learning, moving, running, talking.

Perhaps focusing on learning instead of doing is what makes me feel backward. But learning should be progress. Especially language!
