Speaking with a native accent is unnecessary. It's best to speak properly, like an elementary English teacher. It's easy to listen to accents.

"Just being in a room of people practicing the same level of language helps, as it is progressive and comprehensive."

"The school is a perfect learning environment, but a poor creative one. One had to balance school, work, and life. Maybe."

"Learning a language without a motivation is really difficult. I need reason to talk to people, not just for the sake of practicing."

"The amount of words they learned by being social in 4 hours is equal to 5 minutes of study time."

"Surround self with elementary mandarin for an hour per day. Study. Go to library for story time, or watch cartoons.*****""

    - 16 year old speaks 20 languages. 6 fluent, 10 well.
    - how?
    - his answer: exposure, learn by context — personal life, songs, Wikipedia, etc., constantly thinking in language
    - his method: after a very basic understanding of pronunciation and grammar (even just pimsleur), jumps into native material, reading perhaps an article per day in another language on Wikipedia. Also flash cards for memory. Grammar is key, but not needed for just tourism.
    - always talking in his head throughout the day, sometimes out loud

  - a website with out Assimil without Toil series and an interesting series “English by Nature” and other languages where you read excerpts of literature

TV Series:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extr@ 
  - French, German, Spanish
Any sitcom really

book series:
Assiimil > Colloquial > Teach Yourself

Living Language - the beginner part of Ultimate series is equal to the current complete
Assimil - 1950s first edition was good and kinda fun because it had a lot of culture and written by the original author, 1970/80s second edition was better because it had more content and the print was perfected with the dialogue and translation printed side by side; it also had newly recorded clean audio, 2004 was trash
Linguaphone - 1950’s/60’s > 70’s
Teach Yourself - 1940’s/50’s are first generation grammar based, 1970’s/80’s reissues, 1990s second generation, newest ones are basically phrasebooks
Colloquial - same as Teach Yourself, 1940s also was grammar based ending with literature and 3500 words, 1980s has a grammar based but with a silly answer key not having translations and about 1500 words, 2000s version is a phrasebook and about 900 words

A grammar based audio book and radio I feel may be best because it's the most creative. One can listen to Pimsleur, then use the radio to gain a vocabulary, then combine the two to create simple structured sentences, which allows one to create immediately, as opposed to having a dull passive phase. One keeps creating, talking in the language in the mind.*

One can still use Assmil, but begin the "active" phase immediately by translating sentences from English. Find simple grammar structures. Use a different source to gain vocabulary via context (life or radio). Begin writing and thinking in the language, using a dictionary to find words one does not know.

Talk to people online

search amazon for best book for each language, then follow it, then take a class, then talk and podcast and watch films, or, move to the country

Directions for Assimil:
1. Listen to the text with the book closed. It does not matter if you do not understand what is said. You will gain a general impression of the sounds, hearing the pronunciation without being influenced by the spelling.
2. Listen to the recording a second time while looking at the English translation.
X/3. Read the Dutch text aloud (with the aid of the phonetic transcription if necessary). Be sure you understand the meaning of each sentence, comparing it with the translation as required.
4. Now read the Dutch text again, but this time without looking at the translation.
5. Listen to the recording twice, once while looking at the English translation, and once while looking at the Dutch text.
6. Listen to the recording again with the book closed. At this point you should understand what is being said.
7. Listen to the recording once more. Stop the machine after each sentence, and try to repeat it aloud.
8. Carefully read the comments several times. Examine the Dutch sentences being explained. These notes are very important.
9. Read the exercises. Repeat each sentence several times. The exercises review material from the current lesson and from preceding lessons. If you have forgotten certain words, consult the English translation.
10. Examine the examples of sentence structure. They show how words and phrases are combined in Dutch, which is not always the same as in English.

test rosetta stone and pimsleur mandarin
  - do they teach as much grammar as the book does? Does it have creative activities? Is there any point you recall the information (test, creative)? Recalling creates memories.
  - both suck. One grammar books covers an entire pimsleur series, and allows one to create sentences. Rosetta Stone is also meh.

language exchange:
http://italki.com/
http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/index.html

language priority
-2. Practice (recall), Talk (recall), Test (recall)
  - place yourself in a social situation daily.
    - not possible every time. Live your own life. Use media when you can't travel.
  - just talk (or write)
    - in your head, out loud, on iPhone, whatever, just need to form sentences
  - use a language exchange service
  - live in a country in which they speak it and forbid the use of English
-1. Listen to everyday conversation
  - sitcoms such as Taiwan's Two Fathers and Korea's "Three Friends" are best
    - sitcoms are much better than dramas and films
    - comedy sitcoms are actually watchable
  - need to watch for context
  - need to talk to respond quickly, without thinking
  - need to do once per day
-1. Practice conversation
  - use a language exchange service over the internet*


tips to self:

Keep a dictionary on iPhone for each language.

just talk. Ask questions. Don't use English.

learn and memorize more, then listen for the new words, then repeat
learn the written language, so that I practice while reading
try talking only in the language, even if the person knows English

how to learn redux:
move to the country and work at a job in which you face customers

software:

  - pimsleur
    - test highest level
      - level three is equivalent to book one, with less grammar, I think, and maybe even slower
      - there is a level four apparently
    - must respond out loud
    - doesn’t come with scripts to read
    - does pimsleur provide activities to actually create / learn?
      - it asks the listener to translate an english sentence to Chinese
        - use the workbook that comes with Chinese Practical audio-visual
