learning chinese:
So my view is: get a private teacher. Failing that, simply pick the cheapest and/or geographically most convenient institute and do what you can. With luck you might stumble onto a group (larger institutes probably hold more chance of that, but usually demand more admissions procedures.)

Dear Mr. Patel,
Thank you for your mail.
At our division, if you start from very beginning, for the first 3 books, you may expect to finish one book per season (which is about 180 hours).
And it takes about 1.5 season to complete the 4th book and 2 seasons for 5th book.

just some thoughts:
  - maybe the logographic system exists because China has so many dialects, and so they created one writing system to communicate to each county
  - China is comparable to Europe in size, so having different languages should be perceived as normal. It just feels crazy because it's part of the same country.


how to write IPA in mac?
  - http://linguisticmystic.com/2007/03/08/using-ipa-fonts-with-mac-os-x-the-comprehensive-guide/

find an IPA to Chinese character keyboard layout to avoid learning zhuyin and pinyin
  - or perhaps handwriting with a touchpad is best
