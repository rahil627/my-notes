from a bunch of screenshots from my smartphone:

from Wikipedia:
**Super organisms tend to exhibit the behaviors of homeostasis, power law, scaling, persistent disequilibrium and emergent behaviors.**

from the comic about the guy from Hitch the World:
“STUDY! GET A JOB! BUY A HOUSE! MAKE A FAMILY!” shouts the parent to the baby.

some Wikipedia article about Yanomami people:
**Sexual jealousy causes much of the violence.**
…
**Gold was found in the Yanomami territory in the early 1970s and the inevitable influx of miners brought disease, alcoholism, and violence. Yanomami culture was severely endangered.**
  - **commodity of gold attracts another civilization, causing death in multiple ways**
    - surely oil still does the same now to oil-rich countries
…
CCPY is a Brazilian NGO focused on improving health care and education for Yanomami. Established in 1978 by photographer Claudia Andujar, anthropologist Bruce Albert and Catholic missionary Carlo Zacquini.
  - **very cool mix of people with good intentions, from professional media to real changes in the world**
In 2000, **CCPY sponsored a project to foster a market or Yanomami grown fruit trees.** This project aimed to help the Yanomami as they transition to an increasingly more sedentary lifestyle due to environmental and political pressures. **In a separate venture the CCPY, as per request of the Yanomami leaders, established Yanomami schools that teach Portuguese, aiming to aid the Yanomami in their navigation of Brazilian politics and international arenas in their struggle to defend land rights.** Additionally, these village schools teach Yanomami about Brazilian society, including money use, good production, and record keeping.
  - **intensive farming techniques for commodity surplus value**
  - **bottom-up civic governance**

some Wikipedia article:
~about polygamy and polygyny found in sub-Saharan Africa and West Africa, for valuing one gender more than the other for their ability to farm work and child-bearing ability.
…
Polyandry is believed to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources…among poor and elite families. For example, in the Himalayan mountains, polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided…In Europe, this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance (leaving disinherited siblings to become celibate monks and priests).
  - **property as major factor / reason to love or to not love**
  - **impartible inheritance is a cultural choice**

from an article by Spiegel media about Tatunca of the Amazons:
“My daughter told me that she had met a German Indian. Tatlnca sent her love letters by military mail. they were stamped Top Secret. Then the two of them moved to the Rio Negro and lived among the Yanomami Indians for years, until their two children had to go to school.” Katz appears to have no doubts about the origins of her son-in-law. She and her husband followed their daughter to Barccelos, where they opened a small hotel. Most of Tatunca’s children ended up in Barcelos, including the three who were not supposed to return to the rainforest.

from Wikipedia article for “unconditional love” [unsure]:
**In ethology, the study of animal behavior, unconditional love would refer to altruism which in turn refers to the behavior by individuals that increases the fitness of another while decreasing the fitness of the individual committing the act. In psychology, unconditional love refers to a state of mind in which one has the goal of increasing the welfare of another, despite any evidence of benefit for oneself.** The term is also widely used in family and couples counseling manuals. Dogs are often considered to be examples of animals displaying unconditional love.

from Wikipedia article for “mono no aware”:
Ozu…frequently climaxing with a character very understatedly saying “li tench desu ne? (Fine weather, isn’t it?)”, after **a familial and societal paradigm shift**, such as a daughter being married off, against the backdrop of a swiftly changing Japan.

Wiki on Logo centrism:
This one dimensionality of writing means that only words can be represented through alphabetic writing, and, more often than not, tone, voice, accent and style are difficult if not impossible to represent

Il Posto:
The norms of society are prevalent. Family household, a father that works, a mother that cooks and asks for oil from the store, a child must do some homework before going to school, all of whom wake up and do these things without thinking about why. Feels like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Hitching rides so casually. Jia Zhangke did the same on he back of bicycles. Physical life is habitualized, no worries. Then continues to sneak on a train.

Modern architecture blight in Lombardy in the 60s.

People wait for a test, so strange, like the event Zizek ran in New York. Culture is strange, fucked up, outside of Taiwan. The main character is thrown into the city to socialize. Lol, an old man finds it silly that a company uses a test to hire people, awesome.

At the restaurant, he is only given choices of what to eat, what exists in the city.

Window shopping, commodity.

Paid for a sip of coffee? No, paid for the experience.

Mmm, rampant modern architecture is a recurring theme in many neorealism films, Zhangke, Yang de Chan, and many more.

Stopped. Skipped through.

Quite a classic of a neorealism coming of age film. It reminded me of 400 Blows, which I don't quite remember. Urbanization, socialization, it's all there. The city and it's society does not make sense. Urban life is a mess of events and chance.




Zizek!:
他對世界，不喜歡跟不關心的中間。

他在學校演講。真多孩子有時間。不需要錢，可是有辦法去那邊聽。

之前人想世界可能有什麼政治的主意，現在我們不想，只有接受世界的資本主義。

他說應該想要一個空，所以可以想理想國。

他用馬克思主義的資本主義的批評跟精神分析。

把他的廚房的櫃子有什麼都東西，大部分的是衣服。他也準備書，通報，外文書。有很多書。他的書架超大。他應該知道很多的思想。他什麼都準備。

他不要讓理論縮小，所以他不要參加哲學，因為需要時間。
  - 阿，對啊，我也不要，我也有一樣的問題：時間。我也想要讀書，去旅行。

哈哈，他年輕的時候好看啊！

在columbia大學，zizek演講。

今天誰相信什麼？他說今天我們不想cynical-沒有價值，什麼的。之前也沒有比較多的價值。他說今天我們信箱比較多，最多。

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler
  - Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory.
    - reminds me how I discovered MIT Civic Media is a combination of Media Lab and Comparitive Lit.
 - She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School.
 - In addition, she joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.
 - Judith Butler was born in Cleveland, Ohio,[9] to a family of Hungarian and Russian Jewish descent.[10] Most of her maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust.[11] As a child and teenager, she attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where she received her "first training in philosophy."[12] Butler stated in a 2010 interview with Haaretz that she began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by her Hebrew school's Rabbi because she was "too talkative in class."[11] Butler also stated that she was "thrilled" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what she wanted to study in these special sessions, she responded with three questions preoccupying her at the time: "Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?"

我們怕相信太多，可是我得相信，生活

他27歲，他的父母照顧他，因為他不可能教書，寫書，沒辦法準備錢。

他不喜歡狂熱愛的人。

他有自己的世界。

lacan:
沒有真理，語文不夠，是這個不可能的事情幫真理拿到real近一點點。

他喜歡enlightenment，比較清楚。

lol，他跟別的人差很多。

zizek的問題是時間。他有兒子，可是不喜歡浪費時間。

哲學不解決問題，改變問題。

哲學不是很笨的問題，是我們怎麼動東西，怎麼動freedom。簡要，freedom是什麼？

"Today's hedonism combines pleasure with constraint." Virtual sex, decaffeinated coffee, non-alcoholic beer, chocolate laxative, e-cigarettes. ~this restrained consumption is the main danger.
  - I'm guessing because it still requires material production.

It is because people enjoy it, the sensory experience. It doesn't matter if the material is real or not.
  - and to this I answer with nature. People should enjoy nature, not the consumable work of others.

Uneasiness of civilization, individuals have to make psychological cuts to be normalized to culture.
  - not useful information. Socialization.

There is no normal culture. Culture as such has to be interpreted.
  - duh

Paradox of surplus enjoyment:
Surplus attaches itself to some normal, fundamental enjoyment, because enjoyment as such emerges only in the surplus.

If we subtract the surplus we lose enjoyment, just as in capitalism, which can survive only by incessantly revolutionizing its own material conditions***, ceases to exist if it achieves an internal balance.
  - with each technological revolution, material is changed, and capitalism derives its wealth from the change in material

Surplus Value cycle:
Object causes desire (surplus enjoyment), which causes capitalist production, which produced goods cause desire...

As Freud's framework was a useful tool to describe early capitalism, Lacan's framework is a useful tool to describe late capitalism.

"Drink nothingness itself, the pure semblance of property."

Marxist surplus-value, Lacan's surplus enjoyment, Zizek's paradox of the superego

Zizek doesn't really enjoy politics, speaking to a huge public Left to give answers, he's a theorist, he enjoys creating theories.
  - I also just enjoy theory, well, idea-making, which may sometimes lead to implementing a design, but in the most efficient manner, like urban interventions such as Bansky. I don't enjoy gathering physical material, crafting, and so on.

Zizek到了紐約，我覺得紐約的資本主義太大，廣告，商店，都沒有用。可是，公公人可以去參加zizek的事情。那是最有重要。

在紐約人等比較大的人說話。可是事情也是社會的。人總是說話。

The Left wants a radical revolution, but continue living prosperously, or, "we want a revolution without a revolution".

He analyzes, frustrates, questions.
