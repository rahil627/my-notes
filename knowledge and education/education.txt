  - Intelligence Squared - looks current politics oriented, ideas that may update the current government, but very obvious ones, it's nothing new: getting jobs anywhere, too many students, legally drugs, etc.
  - http://www.thedolectures.com/ - The idea is a simple one. That people who Do things, can inspire the rest of us to go and Do things too. So each year, we invite a set of people to come and tell us what they Do.

  - I present here the best general interest true films I've found. I define true films as documentaries, educational films, instructional how-to's, and what the British call factuals - a non-fiction visual account." by Kevin Kelly

Montaigne
Montessori
John Dewey
Fluxus
Babycastles

Self-learning tips / manifesto:
  - action and experience is the best education
  - avoid sole passive learning, do something while listening to the audio, listen during commutes and breaks
  - The Great Courses is best for history or simple intros to science, not nearly as complex as modern arguments, for that use modern books
  - large modern books should be digested slowly (via audio books at random times), then write a criticism of it

current resoures:
action / experience
books (and audiobooks)
  - use documentaries for Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse
the great courses
language books
wikipedia

try to avoid video related media, it detaches you from the real world and action:
connections (tv series)
cannes, berlin, and venice winning films - see films.txt
