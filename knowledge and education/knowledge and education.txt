These games taught us to read, honed our mathematic skills, entertained us on rainy days, and where the storybooks of my generation, long live final fantasy and it's contribution to modern youth<3﻿”

just a random browse:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banishment_room
   - “A banishment room (also known as a chasing-out-room and a boredom room) is a modern employee exit management strategy whereby employees are transferred to another department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit.[1][2][3] Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethicality of the practice is questionable and may be construed as constructive dismissal in some regions.

The practice, which is not officially acknowledged, is common in Japan which has strong labor laws and a tradition of permanent employment.”
    - holy moly. Problem of permanent employment. As opposed to nomadic lifestyle. Maybe same goes for Korea.

with others from the Philippines.

The Art Story:
http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm
"Ideas alone can be works of art; they are in a chain of development that may eventually find some form. All ideas need not be made physical." - Lenin

from a side-quotes:
"In order to gain some insight into the forces that elevate certain products to the level of 'works of art' it is helpful - among other investigations - to look into the economic and political underpinnings of the institutions, individuals and groups who share in the control of power."
  - a rather critical theory of how arts get pedastaled

“When objects are presented within the context of art (and until recently objects always have been used) they are as eligible for aesthetic consideration as are any objects in the world, and an aesthetic consideration of an object existing in the realm of art means that the object's existence or functioning in an art context is irrelevant to the aesthetic judgment."
  - maybe need to reread when my stomach isn’t struggling

“All of the significant art of today stems from Conceptual art. This includes the art of installation, political, feminist, and socially directed art."
  - I started with installation, and the thinking of ideas to physically create.


One and Three Chairs (1965)
Artist: Joseph Kosuth
A physical chair sits between a scale photograph of a chair and a printed definition of the word "chair." Emblematic of Conceptual art, One and Three Chairs makes people question what constitutes the "chair" - the physical object, the idea, the photograph, or a combination of all three.
  - much like philosophy, when Descartes or Russell asks what attributes a chair is composed of, brown, four-legged, etc.

Vertical Earth Kilometer (1977)
Artist: Walter de Maria
Artwork description & Analysis: The idea underlying this piece was the creation of an actual yet invisible work of art. With the help of an industrial drill, de Maria dug a narrow hole in the ground exactly one kilometer deep, inserted a two-inch diameter brass rod of the same length, then concealed it with a sandstone plate. A small hole was cut in the plate's center to reveal a small portion of the rod, which is perfectly level with the ground. The result is a permanent work of art that people are forced to imagine but may never actually see. As a complementary piece to Vertical Earth Kilometer, de Maria created the far more visible Broken Kilometer (1979), which consisted of five hundred two-meter-long brass rods, neatly arranged on an exhibition floor space in five parallel rows of one hundred rods each. In keeping with Conceptual artists' dispensation of traditional materials and formal concerns, this work defies the marketplace: it can't be sold or entirely exhibited. Further, its simplicity and largely concealed quality makes it anti-expressive and consistent with the period's many paradoxical negations of the visual in "visual art."
  - lol, very cool. A kilometer-length rod! Crazy. Oh what humans do.

Grapefruit (1964)
Artist: Yoko Ono
Artwork description & Analysis: Yoko Ono's extremely plain-looking and oddly titled book, Grapefruit, first released in 1964, is an important early example of Conceptual art and of the link between it and Fluxus. Although the work, technically speaking, is an object, the art extends beyond its material constraints as it contains a series of artistic "event scores" - various instructions for readers to carry out, if they so choose. Listing some 150 sets of instructions divided into five sections (Music, Painting, Event, Poetry, and Object), Grapefruit acts as something of a user's manual in the Fluxus tradition with a perspective similar to Joseph Beuys's that "every human being is an artist." This book not only subordinates the importance of the physical object to the document or springboard for artistic practice, but also allows for execution of the works by anyone, potentially resulting in an infinite number of artworks stemming from one source. As with other Conceptual works, however, whether the instructions are in fact carried out is of little importance, as the artistic idea is paramount.
Book - First edition of 500, Wunternaum Press, Tokyo
  - cute

Museum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles, Financial Section (1970-71)
Artist: Marcel Broodthaers
Artwork description & Analysis: In 1968 Belgian artist Marcel Broodthaers opened his Museum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles as an impermanent conceptual museum that would appear as installations in "sections" at various times and locations between 1968 and 1971. In 1970-71, stressing the economic functioning of cultural institutions, Broodthaers declared the Museum's bankruptcy; he made a corresponding Financial Section through which he tried to raise funds with the sale of specially cast gold bars, or ingot.
  - much like Banksy’s film


MoMA Poll (1970)
Artist: Hans Haacke
Artwork description & Analysis: For the Museum of Modern Art's 1970 exhibition Information, Haacke conceived of a questionnaire in which museum visitors would be invited to vote on a current sociopolitical issue and submit their answers via written ballot, and deposited in one of two transparent boxes, allowing people to approximate the quantity of submissions. The poll asked, "Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?" This question, which was not revealed to the museum before the opening of the show, drove at the heart of MoMA as an institution since Governor Rockefeller was a major donor to the museum as well as a board member. There were visibly twice as many YES ballots as NOs, making the result all the more striking given the location and context of the poll itself. Haacke's MoMA Poll is a key early example of Conceptual art's politically motivated vein of institutional critique, and should by no means be mistaken for an impartial survey. Set in motion by the artist, the work had an unforeseeable conclusion, and was only completed by the audience. In this way, Haacke emphasizes that it is not just up to the artist to make a work of art. All works of art are dependent on a consensus for their validation as works of art (a museum purchases a work and validates it, a collector collects it, a publisher makes it "art" by promoting it as such in a magazine or a book about art.) This work demonstrates the belief that artistic production is in fact a collective, not an individual, process.
  - hmmm, art curation / aesthetic judgment is a collective process?

Imponderabilia (1977)
Artist: Marina Abramovic
Artwork description & Analysis: For Imponderabilia, Marina Abramovic and her longtime partner Ulay face each other, completely nude, and flank the entrance of the museum, obliging visitors to turn and squeeze through the nude bodies to enter. While the piece is obviously designed to draw immediate attention to the performers' nudity, the real concept at work is the exploration of the public's reaction; to the nudity, the performers' placement, and most importantly, the way in which individual visitors choose to enter. Do they appear demure or embarrassed while entering? Do they opt to face Abramovic or Ulay while passing through? Do they choose to enter the museum at all? Abramovic and Ulay carry out their concept in the most dispassionate manner possible, thus leaving expression (commonly considered an artistic aim) to the visitors. The resulting photographs and video of the performance act as something of a study in human behavior when faced with something truly strange, even stressful. Their work demonstrates the kinship between what are usually separated out as distinct trends - Performance art and Conceptual art - but it also distinguishes itself from much Conceptual art in its constant reference to the body, to risk, and the tension between the artists' clinical disinterest and the potential for strong emotional response to the work.
  - very simple, body movement game-like thing

http://www.theartstory.org/movement-fluxus.htm
  - George Maciunas is historically considered the primary founder and organizer of the movement, who described Fluxus as, "a fusion of Spike Jones, gags, games, Vaudeville, Cage and Duchamp."
    - too art history oriented. Narrow.
  - Like the Futurists and Dadaists before them, Fluxus **artists did not agree with the authority of museums to determine the value of art**, **nor did they believe that one must be educated to view and understand a piece of art.**  **Fluxus not only wanted art to be available to the masses**, they also **wanted everyone to produce art all the time.** It is often difficult to define Fluxus, as many Fluxus artists claim that the act of defining the movement is, in fact, too limiting and reductive.
  - Unlike previous artistic movements, **Fluxus sought to change the history of the world, not just the history of art.** **The persistent goal of most Fluxus artists was to destroy any boundary between art and life.**
  - A central Fluxus tenet was to dismiss and mock the elitist world of "high art" and to find any way possible to bring art to the masses, much in keeping with the social climate of the 1960s. **Fluxus artists used humor to express their intent** and, along with Dada, Fluxus was one of the few art movements to use humor throughout history. **Despite their playful attitude, Fluxus artists were serious about their desire to change the balance of power in the art world.** Their irreverence for "high art" had an impact on the perceived authority of the museum to determine what, and who, constituted "art."
  - Fluxus art involved the viewer, relying on the element of chance to shape the ultimate outcome of the piece. The use of chance was also employed by Dada, Marcel Duchamp, and other performance art of the time, such as Happenings. Fluxus artists were most heavily influenced by the ideas of John Cage, who believed that one should embark on a piece without having a conception of the eventual end. **It was the process of creating that was important, not the finished product.**
  - Fluxus and Zen: Zen is a Japanese Buddhist philosophy that focuses on meditation and the **importance of the present moment.** **No single moment is to be more important than another in life.** Zen had a powerful impact on John Cage who thought that **art should be concerned with equivalency of values instead of elevating artistic experiences from everyday experiences** - **”in this way art becomes important as a means to make one aware of one's actual environment.”** This comes directly from Buddhist teachings on the importance of being aware of every moment and present in every moment in life.
  .Fluxus artists sought to apply that philosophy to art…Maciunas himself was less concerned with the Zen aspect of things and more concerned with a **political**, nonsensical, and anti-art stance.
  - The influence of Fluxus resonates throughout the arts particularly with later incarnations of Performance art, **Land art**, and **Graffiti/Street art**, and those artists who deliberately work outside established museum systems. An artist like **Banksy** is a good example of the continuation of the Fluxus philosophy.
  - Total Art Matchbox by Ben Vautier: The piece is a box of matches with "directions" printed on the cover stating, "USE THESE MATCHES TO DESTROY ALL ART - MUSEUMS ART LIBRARY'S - READY-MADES - POP-ART AND AS I BEN SIGNED EVERYTHING WORK OF ART - BURN - ANYTHING - KEEP LAST MATCH FOR THIS MATCH -" This piece literally proclaims the Fluxus belief in anti-art and is one of many "editions" manufactured. Often Fluxus artists would produce a large number of identical pieces to deliberately devalue the object. It can be assumed that many of these boxes were burned as per the instructions on the cover, the involvement of the viewer completing the piece.
    - no care for art objects or past art works. It’s reality that matters. lol. I think this way too. Silly, but steeped in reality, much further into the reality of the world, politics, etc. compared to the rest, who are habituated to live in their simple ways. Must bring about political awareness, political change.
  - Related Art and Artists, Coyote: I Like America and America Likes Me (1974) by Joseph Beuys: For three consecutive days in May, 1974, Beuys enclosed himself in a gallery with a wild coyote. Having previously announced that he would not enter the United States while the Vietnam War proceeded, this piece was his first and only action in America, and Beuys was ferried between the airport and the gallery in an ambulance to ensure that his feet did not have to touch American soil.
    - very very good performance art, showing the reality of war to people nearby. Otherwise, it’s fantastical.


http://www.theartstory.org/movement-happenings.htm
  -  Happenings involved more than the detached observation of the viewer; the artist engaged with Happenings required the viewer to actively participate in each piece.
  - Key Ideas:
  - A main component of Happenings was the involvement of the viewer. Each instance a Happening occurred the viewer was used to add in an element of chance so, every time a piece was performed or exhibited it would never be the same as the previous time. Unlike preceding works of art which were, by definition, static, Happenings could evolve and **provide a unique encounter for each individual who partook in the experience.**
  - **The concept of the ephemeral was important to Happenings, as the performance was a temporary experience, and, as such could not be exhibited in a museum in the traditional sense. The only artifacts remaining from original Happenings are photographs and oral histories. This was a challenge to the art that had previously been defined by the art object itself. Art was now defined by the action, activity, occasion, and/or experience that constituted the Happening, which was fundamentally fleeting and immaterial.**
  - Happenings:
  - Yard (1961), Artist: Allan Kaprow, Artwork description & Analysis: Yard by Kaprow involved the random scattering and piling of tires over the floor and **an invitation to visitors to climb over them.** This piece was supposedly in response to Jackson Pollack's "drip" paintings: the incorporation of chance as a mainstay of the work, but with a certain amount of control left to the artist. Just as Pollock had a certain amount of power over his drip paintings, aesthetics were still very much subject to chance. Here Kaprow used the tires as Pollock used his paint. The result- a haphazard pile of tires nevertheless circumscribed into a semblance of compositional order- is a three-dimensional translation of Pollock's practice. **Kaprow's pieces often involved materials from everyday life, including people; Kaprow stated, "Life is much more interesting than art.” Yard, like many Happenings, has been recreated several times since Kaprow's initial installation, and each time a unique artwork is produced.**
  - Stamp Vendor (1961), Artist: Robert Watts, Artwork description & Analysis: Stamp Vendor involved stamps that artist Robert Watts created and placed inside of actual stamp dispensers that Watts "borrowed" from the United States Post Office. The "borrowing" (stealing) was in protest of certain policies of the United States government at the time Watts deemed oppressive. The stamp dispensers were put on display in exhibitions and viewers could purchase the stamps by placing coins in the coin slots. The stamps, designed by Watts, had different images on them ranging from gas cans to nude women. This piece differs from many other Happenings for the smaller, more intimate scale and for the fact that the viewer was interacting with an object as opposed to a person. Also, unlike many other Happenings that eschewed the traditional art object, it should be noted that by interacting with the Stamp Vendor, **the viewer was then able to take with them a work of art: the stamp created by Watts.**

Metanews:
Very easy to see media problems, straight from the title of the news.

Scientific history is stupid. People still don't have an imagination of social reality. They rely on evidence as opposed to experience social life. Finding a jewelry is a "skill" as opposed to their everyday life of communication. Finding deep-sea fishing gear on an island, as if they couldn't imagine it

Oh crap, was reading New Scientist. Useless.

Oh, it aggregates useless online media.

4/8
Emerson wiki:
Emerson wrote most of his important essays as lectures first, then revised them for print.
  - oral, action, art, then record

Emerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical tenets, but developing certain ideas
  - no teleo / system, just ideas

He remains among the linchpins of the American romantic movement.

When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was "the infinitude of the private man."

Emerson is also well known as a mentor and friend of fellow Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau.

In October 1817, at 14, Emerson went to Harvard College.

Midway through his junior year, Emerson began keeping a list of books he had read and started a journal in a series of notebooks that would be called "Wide World". [age 16-17]

By his senior year, Emerson decided to go by his middle name, Waldo. [chose mother's name, because she raised him]

He did not stand out as a student and graduated in the exact middle of his class of 59 people.

In 1826, faced with poor health, Emerson went to seek out warmer climates. He first went to Charleston, South Carolina, but found the weather was still too cold.[21] He then went further south, to St. Augustine, Florida, where he took long walks on the beach and began writing poetry.
  - **need to regulate body, yet spend time outside, in reality, in nature**

While in St. Augustine he made the acquaintance of Prince Achille Murat. Murat, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, was only two years his senior; they became extremely good friends and enjoyed one another's company. The two engaged in enlightening discussions on religion, society, philosophy, and government, and Emerson considered Murat an important figure in his intellectual education.
  - **travel mate education**

While in St. Augustine, Emerson had his first experience of slavery.
  - sees the terrible things society does

After Harvard, Emerson assisted his brother William[24] in a school for young women[25] established in their mother's house, after he had established his own school in Chelmsford, Massachusetts; when his brother William[26] went to Göttingen to study divinity, Emerson took charge of the school. Over the next several years, Emerson made his living as a schoolmaster, then went to Harvard Divinity School.
  - teaching in one own's home, private institution, for women!

Emerson's brother Edward,[27] two years younger than he, entered the office of lawyer Daniel Webster, after graduating from Harvard first in his class. Edward's physical health began to deteriorate and he soon suffered a mental collapse as well; he was taken to McLean Asylum in June 1828 at age 23. Although he recovered his mental equilibrium, he died in 1834 from apparently longstanding tuberculosis.[28] Another of Emerson's bright and promising younger brothers, Charles, born in 1808, died in 1836, also of tuberculosis,[29] making him the third young person in Emerson's innermost circle to die in a period of a few years.
...
Emerson met his first wife, Ellen Louisa Tucker, in Concord, New Hampshire, on Christmas Day 1827, and married her when she was 18.[30] The couple moved to Boston, with Emerson's mother Ruth moving with them to help take care of Ellen, who was already sick with tuberculosis.[31] Less than two years later, Ellen died at the age of 20 
  - strange, may influenced to go into nature

merson toured Europe in 1833 and later wrote of his travels in English Traits (1856).[41] He left aboard the brig Jasper on Christmas Day, 1832, sailing first to Malta.[42] During his European trip, he spent several months in Italy, visiting Rome, Florence and Venice, among other cities. When in Rome, he met with John Stuart Mill, who gave him a letter of recommendation to meet Thomas Carlyle. He went to Switzerland, and had to be dragged by fellow passengers to visit Voltaire's home in Ferney, "protesting all the way upon the unworthiness of his memory".[43] He then went on to Paris, a "loud modern New York of a place",[44] where he visited the Jardin des Plantes. He was greatly moved by the organization of plants according to Jussieu's system of classification, and the way all such objects were related and connected. As Richardson says, "Emerson's moment of insight into the interconnectedness of things in the Jardin des Plantes was a moment of almost visionary intensity that pointed him away from theology and toward science"
  - wowowowow

Moving north to England, Emerson met William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle in particular was a strong influence on Emerson; Emerson would later serve as an unofficial literary agent in the United States for Carlyle, and in March 1835, he tried to convince Carlyle to come to America to lecture.[46] The two would maintain correspondence until Carlyle's death in 1881.
  - great city friends

Emerson returned to the United States on October 9, 1833, and lived with his mother in Newton, Massachusetts, until October, 1834, when he moved to Concord, Massachusetts, to live with his step-grandfather Dr. Ezra Ripley at what was later named The Old Manse.[48] Seeing the budding Lyceum movement, which provided lectures on all sorts of topics, Emerson saw a possible career as a lecturer. On November 5, 1833, he made the first of what would eventually be some 1,500 lectures, discussing The Uses of Natural History in Boston. This was an expanded account of his experience in Paris.[49] In this lecture, he set out some of his important beliefs and the ideas he would later develop in his first published essay Nature:
  - back home, communicate one's ideas as much as possible in an independent academic setting.

On September 8, 1836, the day before the publication of Nature, Emerson met with Frederic Henry Hedge, George Putnam and George Ripley to plan periodic gatherings of other like-minded intellectuals.[65] This was the beginning of the Transcendental Club, which served as a center for the movement. Its first official meeting was held on September 19, 1836.[66] On September 1, 1837, women attended a meeting of the Transcendental Club for the first time. Emerson invited Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Hoar and Sarah Ripley for dinner at his home before the meeting to ensure that they would be present for the evening get-together.[67] Fuller would prove to be an important figure in Transcendentalism.
  - physical meetings to create an institution

In 1837, Emerson befriended Henry David Thoreau. Though they had likely met as early as 1835, in the fall of 1837, Emerson asked Thoreau, "Do you keep a journal?" The question went on to be a lifelong inspiration for Thoreau.[73] Emerson's own journal comes to 16 large volumes, in the definitive Harvard University Press edition published between 1960 and 1982. Some scholars consider the journal to be Emerson's key literary work.[74]
  - **journal as main work, and measure of others**

He would eventually give as many as 80 lectures a year, traveling across the northern part of the United States. He traveled as far as St. Louis, Des Moines, Minneapolis, and California.

In January 1842 Emerson's first son Waldo died from scarlet fever.[86] Emerson wrote of his grief in the poem "Threnody" ("For this losing is true dying"),[87] and the essay "Experience". That same month, William James was born, and Emerson agreed to be his godfather.

Bronson Alcott announced his plans in November 1842 to find "a farm of a hundred acres in excellent condition with good buildings, a good orchard and grounds".[88] Charles Lane purchased a 90-acre (360,000 m2) farm in Harvard, Massachusetts, in May 1843 for what would become Fruitlands, a community based on Utopian ideals inspired in part by Transcendentalism.[89] The farm would run based on a communal effort, using no animals for labor; its participants would eat no meat and use no wool or leather.[90] Emerson said he felt "sad at heart" for not engaging in the experiment himself.[91] Even so, he did not feel Fruitlands would be a success. "Their whole doctrine is spiritual", he wrote, "but they always end with saying, Give us much land and money".[92] Even Alcott admitted he was not prepared for the difficulty in operating Fruitlands. "None of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed. So we fell apart", he wrote.[93] After its failure, Emerson helped buy a farm for Alcott's family in Concord[92] which Alcott named "Hillside".[93]

He addressed the Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and the Gloucester Lyceum, among others.

The trip left an important imprint on Emerson's later work. His 1856 book English Traits is based largely on observations recorded in his travel journals and notebooks. Emerson later came to see the American Civil War as a 'revolution' that shared common ground with the European revolutions of 1848.

1844 on, he took a more active role in opposing slavery.
  - active social reform, contradicts "Nature", doesn't it?

In the spring of 1871 Emerson took a trip on the transcontinental railroad, barely two years after its completion. Along the way and in California he met a number of dignitaries, including Brigham Young during a stopover in Salt Lake City. Part of his California visit included a trip to Yosemite, and while there he met a young and unknown John Muir, a signature event in Muir's career.
 - more travel, railway makes it easier

While the house was being rebuilt, Emerson took a trip to England, continental Europe, and Egypt. He left on October 23, 1872, along with his daughter Ellen[138] while his wife Lidian spent time at the Old Manse and with friends.[139] Emerson and his daughter Ellen returned to the United States on the ship Olympus along with friend Charles Eliot Norton on April 15, 1873.[140] Emerson's return to Concord was celebrated by the town and school was canceled that day

Google humanistic geography
Critical geography wiki:
Turning points in geography:

Human geography:
Sub-fields:
Cultural geography is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places, as well as their relations. It focuses on describing and analysing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.
...
Political geography is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures.
...
Settlement geography, including urban geography, is the study of urban and rural areas with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement. That is the study of areas which have a concentration of buildings and infrastructure. These are areas where the majority of economic activities are in the secondary sector and tertiary sectors. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high population density.

Philosophical and theoretical approaches:
...various philosophical approaches can be used in research; therefore, an urban geographer could be a Feminist or Marxist geographer, etc.

Critical geography:
**humanistic geography, initially formed part of behavioural geography but fundamentally disagreed with the use of quantitative methods in assessing human behaviour and thoughts in favour of qualitative analysis. Humanistic geography used many of the techniques that the humanities use such as source analysis and the use of text and literature to try to ‘get into the mind’ of the subject(s). Furthermore, Cultural geography revived**


Environmental determinism:
Ibn Khaldun also anticipated the meteorological climate theory later proposed by Montesquieu in the 18th century. Like Montesquieu, Ibn Khaldun studied "the physical environment in which man lives in order to understand how it influences him in his non-physical characteristics." He explained the differences between different peoples, whether nomadic or sedentary peoples, including their customs and institutions, in terms of their "physical environment-habitat, climate, soil, food, and the different ways in which they are forced to satisfy their needs and obtain a living."
...
critics charged that determinism served to justify racism and imperialism. The experience of environmental determinism has left a scar on geography, with many geographers reacting negatively to any suggestion of environmental influences on human society. Some believe this rejection has gone too far, and that incorporating environmental factors into explanations of social outcomes is not only useful but necessary.
...
The fundamental argument of the environmental determinists was that aspects of physical geography, particularly climate, influenced the psychological mind-set of individuals, which in turn defined the behaviour and culture of the society that those individuals formed. For example, tropical climates were said to cause laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle latitudes led to more determined and driven work ethics and thus more civilized and 'stronger' societies.
...
Because these environmental influences operate slowly on human biology, it was important to trace the migrations of groups to see what environmental conditions they had evolved under.Charles Darwin observations appeared to support this conclusion as well, he noted the supremacy of northern life forms over those of the tropics and southern latitudes and extrapolated this idea from plant life to people.[11] However, since evolutionary processes manifest over very long time periods, the ability to adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative at best, and impossible at worst.
...
Stopped reading history and now skimming through main points:
Climate:
**Climate is correlated to agricultural production...agricultural conditions based on climate such as good soil and water supply can give way to dense inland populations.**

Latitude and Longitude:
**As latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita increase.**

Philip Parker: humans originated as tropical mammals, so those located in cold climates feel under pressure to restore their physiological homeostasis, for example by agriculture and wealth-creation to produce more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, those in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. This suggests that GDP per capita is a poor measure of well-being, and that simply incorporating temperature would be a substantial improvement.

Location and land composition:
Coastal regions are common areas for providing capital goods in global trade, are points of financial centers, and are essential to lower transportation costs.[24] **Living on the coast has proven to be advantageous for centuries with people’s livelihood depending on the coastline for trade, irrigation, and fish resources. It has only been in the last few generations that railroads, cars, air transit, and telecommunications have decreased human’s dependence of coast location for economic edge.**

Landlocked countries:
Landlocked countries are surrounded by borders on all sides, with no direct access to the ocean of their own. The exception to stagnated economies for land locked countries are Austria and Switzerland whose proximity to European markets make them un-moldable to typical geographic explanations for underdevelopment...**These countries with neither coastlines nor ocean navigable rivers often have less urbanization and less growth due to the slow movement of information, therefore they are slower in technology advances and communication. They also lack access to regional and international markets.**

Infectious Diseases:
**Almost all of the 200-500 million per year malaria attacks occur in the tropics where the climate is hot, moist and in near the equator.**

Africa Example:
Africa offers examples of the correlation between variables of environmental determinism and poor economic development. Africa’s per capita income has been steadily decreasing for the past 40 years, with Sub-saharan Africa becoming one of the least wealthy areas within the continent.[27] It has a large majority of land mass in the tropics, the population is concentrated in the interior with more than one-fourth residing in landlocked countries, and it has a low population density in the coastal regions. Table 1 and map 1 from Geography and Economic Development outlines the geographic factors associated with development. For example, decent agricultural land is patchy, climate conditions bring low rainfall and risks of drought, high disease rates with malaria are prevalent, and Africa contains many small countries landlocked by borders which brings high transportation costs, and little cohesiveness amongst policies and governing.

Distinguish from other theories:
There are many theories that incorporate factors of the environment into the consideration of why certain places develop faster than others, but **environmental determinism in economic terms puts nature and geography at the focus when understanding the distribution of growth and development.**

Temperature determinism / "equatorial paradox" (puzzle):
Singapore counter example:
**Singapore's strict and no-nonsense government system matches the "strict and authoritarian" system that Montesquieu cited as being necessary for a country in warmer areas to succeed by counteracting the environmental complacency of the tropics with human-induced strictures.** Saudi Arabia is a good example.

"you can lie in a hammock and pick bananas,"[citation needed] as opposed to the need to invent agriculture and economy in order to prosper and survive. [lol]...With this philosophy, geographers were stating that nations outside of the western realm were not capable of developing on their own, and therefore, needed to be 'saved', and taught how to conform to the western way of life.

**The equatorial paradox only emerged from the Modern Era onwards, with more highly developed cultures and economies previously being present in the tropical and subtropical regions than outside it.**

Colonialism:
...The use of environmental determinism allowed for states to rationalize colonization, by claiming that the peoples within the given land were "morally inferior", therefore legitimizing exploitation.[20] Consequently, the use of this theory in explaining, rationalizing and legitimizing racism, ethnocentrism and development, has been strongly criticized, and in recent years, has become mostly obsolete."

Juliette Pierce wiki
Charles remained powerfully attached to Juliette. In a diary entry for January 6, 1889, Charles wrote, regarding Juliette's health, "If I should lose her, I would not survive her. Therefore, I must turn my whole energy to saving her."[9] Except during occasional travels by one or the other, they remained together until his death in 1914, and she never remarried.

His earnings from temporary posts, lectures and articles dwindled, until he and Juliette lived in poverty. At his death he had more than 100,000 pages of unpublished writing.

an interview with Chris Marker
Originally published in Libération, March 5, 2003. With thanks to Antoine de Baecque.
http://www.filmcomment.com/article/marker-direct-an-interview-with-chris-marker/

When Immemory, your CD-rom, was released in 1999, you said that you had found the ideal medium. What do you think of DVD?
With the CD-rom, it’s not so much the technology that’s important as the architecture, the tree-like branching, the play. We’ll make DVD-roms. The DVD technology is obviously superb, but it isn’t always cinema. Godard nailed it once and for all: at the cinema, you raise your eyes to the screen; in front of the television, you lower them. Then there is the role of the shutter. Out of the two hours you spend in a movie theater, you spend one of them in the dark. It’s this nocturnal portion that stays with us, that fixes our memory of a film in a different way than the same film seen on television or on a monitor. But having said that, let’s be honest. I’ve just watched the ballet from An American in Paris on the screen of my iBook, and I very nearly rediscovered the lightness that we felt in London in 1952, when I was there with [Alain] Resnais and [Ghislain] Cloquet during the filming of Statues Also Die, when we started every day by seeing the 10 a.m. show of An American in Paris at a theater in Leicester Square. I thought I’d lost that lightness forever when I saw it on cassette.

Does the democratization of the means of filmmaking (DV, digital editing, distribution via the Internet) seduce the socially engaged filmmaker that you are?

Here’s a good opportunity to get rid of a label that’s been stuck on me. For many people, “engaged” means “political,” and politics, the art of compromise (which is as it should be—if there is no compromise there is only brute force, of which we’re seeing an example right now) bores me deeply. What interests me is history, and politics interests me only to the degree that it represents the mark history makes on the present. With an obsessive curiosity (if I identify with any of Kipling’s characters, it’s the Elephant Boy of the Just-So Stories, because of his “insatiable curiosity”) I keep asking: How do people manage to live in such a world? And that’s where my mania comes from, to see “how things are going” in this place or that. For a long time, those who were best placed to see “how it’s going” didn’t have access to the tools to give form to their perceptions—and perception without form is tiring. And now, suddenly, these tools exist. It’s true that for people like me it’s a dream come true. I wrote about it, in a small text in the booklet of the DVD.

A necessary caution: the “democratization of tools” entails many financial and technical constraints, and does not save us from the necessity of work. Owning a DV camera does not magically confer talent on someone who doesn’t have any or who is too lazy to ask himself if he has any. You can miniaturize as much as you want, but a film will always require a great deal of work—and a reason to do it. That was the whole story of the Medvedkin groups, the young workers who, in the post-’68 era, tried to make short films about their own lives, and whom we tried to help on the technical level, with the means of the time. How they complained! “We come home from work and you ask us to work some more. . . .” But they stuck with it, and you have to believe that something happened there, because 30 years later we saw them present their films at the Belfort festival, in front of an attentive audience. The means of the time was 16mm silent, which meant three-minute camera rolls, a laboratory, an editing table, some way of adding sound—everything that you have now right inside a little case that fits in your hand. A little lesson in modesty for the spoiled children of today, just like the spoiled children of 1970 got their lesson in modesty by putting themselves under the patronage of Alexander Ivanovitch Medvedkin and his ciné-train. For the benefit of the younger generation, Medvedkin was a Russian filmmaker who, in 1936 and with the means that were proper to his time (35mm film, editing table, and film lab installed in the train), essentially invented television: shoot during the day, print and edit at night, show it the next day to the people you filmed (and who often participated in the editing). I think that it’s this fabled and long forgotten bit of history (Medvedkin isn’t even mentioned in Georges Sadoul’s book, considered in its day the Soviet Cinema bible) that underlies a large part of my work—in the end, perhaps, the only coherent part. To try to give the power of speech to people who don’t have it, and, when it’s possible, to help them find their own means of expression. The workers I filmed in 1967 in Rhodesia, just like the Kosovars I filmed in 2000, had never been heard on television: everyone was speaking on their behalf, but once you no longer saw them on the road, bloody and sobbing, people lost interest in them. To my great surprise, I once found myself explaining the editing of Battleship Potemkin to a group of aspiring filmmakers in Guinea-Bissau, using an old print on rusty reels; now those filmmakers are having their films selected for competition in Venice (keep an eye out for the next musical by Flora Gomes). I found the Medvedkin syndrome again in a Bosnian refugee camp in 1993—a bunch of kids who had learned all the techniques of television, with newsreaders and captions, by pirating satellite TV and using equipment supplied by an NGO (nongovernmental organization). But they didn’t copy the dominant language—they just used the codes in order to establish credibility and reclaim the news for other refugees. An exemplary experience. They had the tools and they had the necessity. Both are indispensable.

Do you prefer television, movies on a big screen, or surfing the Internet?
…
And the movies in all this? For the reasons mentioned above, and under the orders of Jean-Luc, I’ve said for a long time that films should be seen first in theaters, and that television and video are only there to refresh your memory. Now that I no longer have any time at all to go to the cinema, I’ve started seeing films by lowering my eyes, with an ever increasing sense of sinfulness (this interview is indeed becoming Dostoevskian). But to tell the truth I no longer watch many films, only those by friends, or curiosities that an American acquaintance tapes for me on TCM. There is too much to see on the news, on the music channels or on the indispensable Animal Channel. And I feed my hunger for fiction with what is by far the most accomplished source: those great American TV series, like The Practiceinspired a video by David Bowie and a film by Terry Gilliam. And there’s also a bar called “La Jetée,” in Japan.

Slavoj Zizek - Reality of the Virtual
People think virtual reality is interesting, but Zizek is interested on how reality is affected by virtual things.

Lacan: Imaginary, Symbolic, Real.

Imaginary virtual: When we have an experience with another person, we extract an virtual image from the other person, as opposed the the real other person. The virtual image is what affects the reality, and how we respond. The rest of the person is ignored. [To me it seems like communication.]

Symbolic virtual: The next level. As an example: paternal authority. In order for the authority to be effective, it must remain virtual in a sense of a threat. If it were direct, it would be a sign of impotence, undermining itself as an authority. If a father lifts his hand, it is virtual, but if the father actually hits, it is actual, and the sense of threat is lost.

Beliefs are virtual. Nobody really believes, we just have to presupposes another person to believe [need to reread this]. Example: Christmas, Democracy. There’s some virtual entity whom we don’t want to disappoint. So then the belief becomes actual.

Our beliefs must remain virtual, because if we were to believe too virtually, because then it would be too self-destructive. We no longer appear normal, but as idiots. For example when a person actually takes religion or politics too seriously, there is something quite monstrous with that person, a puppet.

Real virtual:
To understand the Real virtual, one must go over the triad again, because each node is affected by three nodes:

Imaginary Real: Images that are so traumatic, real, but too strong to be perceived. Examples, catastrophes, The Thing from horror and science fiction. Nonetheless it is imaginary.

Symbolic Real: Example: scientific discourse, scientific formulas, like quantum physics. Why is this real? Because it resists symbolization. It is real but unable to think of it in everyday life. [The feeling I got after reading A Short History of Nearly Everything and Bertrand Russell’s Problems in Philosophy. Ontology.] It just works, but if you try to build an ontology on it, it doesn’t work, it’s meaningless.
  - [I found this interesting, because people must have the memory of symbols in the mind, using it a lens to reality, a kind of ideological goggles. For example, sometimes I think at the level of materials for creativity, materials for economics a la Marx, micro-level for science thoughts, using critical theorist ideas as a lens to describe reality.*]

Real Real: Example: the chants that soldiers give during war — “I don’t know but I was told, Eskimos blah blah blah”. So, a descriptive detail? In the film Sound of Music, it depicts the nazi invasion of Austria, but in the film, nazis are dressed not much different from decadent Jews and the Austrians act not much different than fascists. So the narrative depicts one thing, but at another level, the micro-sense, there is a different message. In this case, it depicts an ideology of democracy while secretly displaying our fascist dreams [whoa]. [Deconstruction? The problem often is that Zizek relies on communication as his test case, as opposed to reality.]

Another example: Robert Altman’s masterpiece: Short Cuts — 9 short stories depicting the life of L.A.’s middle classes: portrayal of alienation, solitude, etc. But, the texture (the Real Real) of the film is much more optimistic, a kind of celebration. It is wrong to watch the film simply as a critique of culture, but worth seeing the texture.

The formula of the Real virtual: Rumsfeld, before War of Iraq, said there are known knowns (Saddam is the leader of the organization), known unknowns (number of nuclear weapons), unknown unknown (things that we don’t know that we don’t know, having some unimaginable weapon). He was missing a fourth category: the unknown knowns (things we don’t know we know but know, part of our culture, but do not recognize it, unconscious in psychoanalysis).

The problem with American politics is just that: that they are not aware of unknown knowns [culture, ingrained social ideas]. The thing that controls us, but we are unaware of.

Virtual Real [finally!]: Example metaphor: attractors of a magnetic field, iron filaments being attracted to a magnetic field? The magnetic field doesn’t exist, but it has an effect: it actually structures the elements around it [again, ideas embedded into the mind or culture but unaware or unconscious of, actually effect reality].

The shift: Example metaphor: There is a shift in Freud similar to Einstein, that, from special to general, in the theory of relativity and in the psychoanalysis of Volfman. That, it isn’t a piece of matter being traumatically affected by another real force (space or traumatic event), but, the reality is that the force already exists, a kind of formal imbalance, and it traumatically affects reality [whoa!]. [So one must shift their focus from the symbolic real to the real real {a reference to the real} to really understand reality. The problems are within culture, ideas, etc., not the symbols of reality.*****]

What does this mean for politics? How to use this to serve us in the analysis of political ideological phenomenon? Example: anti-semitism, the figure of the Jew, is an external trauma that intrudes social balance, curving social space. Class struggle, or more generally, social antagonism comes first. Social space is already curved, imbalanced. In order to account for it, we invent the figure of the Jew.

Economics? Example: example alternative modernity: class struggle, dialectic of enlightenment, problems in capitalism, etc. are a part of modernity, and in thinking of alternatives or the future of modernity, it gets lost. The site of the antagonism is in universal modernism, universality. The site is virtual. All that exists are particular forms of modernity (anglo-saxon, Latin America, fascism, etc.). This is necessary to understand global capitalism. [It seems, basically, that one treat things in particular, not universal, to understand something as large as modernity, or global capitalism.]

The category of the Real is a purely formal category, a structural gap, a pure difference, a difference prior to a difference, a self-difference. Instead of binaries such as the difference in gender, politics, etc., the difference is ontologically within the self, already existing. It is not a multitude as Delueze puts it. The binary signifier is primordially repressed [huh?]. Not human vs inhuman, not dead vs undead [?], a monstrous excess.

Within problems of identity (politics, gender, etc.), the solution is often a multitude, that each identity should be able to develop independently, but this doesn’t work in the case of economics: one does not say the rich and poor should develop independently; it’s antagonistic struggle. [We are a part of the same culture, so one cannot simply develop independently in reality. An anarchic society is impossible. I think that’s what he means. But he is only taking into account modernity, the more developed areas, not different places and spaces.] It is not a universality of pluralities, the universality already exists: the universality of struggle.

The paradox of struggle: universal truth should not be rejected by multiplicity to create independent truths, rather, universal truth exists, and only exists with each particular.

…goes on to commodity excess enjoyment: decaf coffee and soda, especially the structure of the chocolate laxative, etc. Then gives examples using the chocolate laxative structure: in tolerance, people tolerate others to a certain point until it becomes harassment … [forgot argument here], in George Soros (sounded like Soros), he gets money through speculation of markets, then gives toward democracy, in war, all wars are declared in order to maintain peace* (imperialism because of humanitarian intervention), in the case of Iraq War, Iraq wasn’t attacked to remove the threat from Saddam, it was justified to help the people of Iraq. The same applied to concentration camps (a collective justifies punishment to the benefit of society). The same to Guantanamo Bay. Then somehow goes back to commodity, arguing that we aren’t consuming more, but less. Only drug addicts are the real consumers. That is why marijuana is good, it’s the safe opium. So the ethical injunction is not moderation, it’s to enjoy, and it’s what we feel guilty about: that we are not enjoying: you should learn to become a pitiless censor of yourself.

The role of psychoanalysis is not to enable you to enjoy, but now to open a space in which you are not allowed to enjoy. You are not obliged to enjoy, you are allowed not to enjoy, which is different from being prohibited to enjoy.

… [skipped somethings. 1: people who organize their lives into jogging, eating healthy, etc. is not good.]

Reinvent a space of utopia: Not classical utopia of ideal worlds without much intent of realizing it (Plato, Thomas More, Sade), capitalist utopia (allows necrophiliacs to have sex with bodies, satisfying new desires, even extreme ones), the Real utopia — do what appears within the symbolic coordinates as impossible. Example: Nixon in China. Dare to enact the impossible. Modernity can be changed, not post-modernism. Don’t plan, practice utopia. It’s a matter of survival, the future will be utopian, or there will be none.

[overall, it requires much experience in reality and of philosophy (continental, political, etc.) to even understand any of this. Though many arguments are lucid thanks to good examples and metaphors, it’s still very fragmentary. The topics are huge. The particulars are not there. The reality of the environment affecting human decision-making is not there. It is not complex. It is merely using metaphors and new words to describe the world, as much of continental philosophy does. The main idea is simple: look toward cultural problems, which is the basis of critical theory.]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_(Humboldt)
Probably more than any other factor, Humboldt's career was shaped by his travels in South and Central America in the five years from 1799 to 1804.[1] Humboldt said that his Cosmos was born on the slopes of the Andes.[3] Beginning in Venezuela, he explored the Orinoco and upper Amazing valleys, climbed Mount Chimborazo — then believed to be the world's highest mountain — investigated changing vegetation from the tropical jungles to the top of the Andes, collected thousands of plant specimens, and accumulated a vast collection of animals, insects, and geological fragments.[1] From the notes he gathered on this journey, Humboldt was able to produce at least thirty volumes based on his observations.[4] His studies related to many scientific fields, including botany, zoology, geology, and geography, as well as narratives of popular travel and discussions of political, economic, and social conditions.

n 1827, having spent himself into poverty publishing his scientific works, his king, Friedrich Wilhelm III, reminded Humboldt of his debt and recalled him to Berlin. When he arrived in Berlin, Humboldt announced that he would give a course of lectures on physical geography. From November 1827 to April 1828, he delivered a series of sixty-one lectures at the University of Berlin. The lectures were so well-attended, that Humboldt soon announced a second series, which was held in a music hall before an audience of thousands, free to all comers.[3] Beginning in 1828, Humboldt finally gave expression to his concept in his Berlin lectures, and from then on he labored to produce his physical description of the universe in book form.[4] Collaborators pledged to his assistance included the greatest scientists of his generation, including leaders in chemistry, astronomy, anatomy, mathematics, mineralogy, botany, and other areas of study.

In 1828 after the Berlin lectures, Humboldt began formulating his vision in writing. His factual text, heavily loaded with footnotes and references, was sent in proof sheets to all the various specialists for comments and corrections before publication. In this way, he aimed to ensure that what he wrote was both accurate and up-to-date. He continually looked to his friend and literary advisor Varnhagen von Ense for advice in the matter of his style of writing.[4] In total, Kosmos took twenty-five years to write.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution

Stadial theory:
Enlightenment and later thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages: in other words, they saw history as stadial. While expecting humankind to show increasing development, theorists looked for what determined the course of human history.

Max Weber, disenchantment, and critical theory:
Weber's major works in economic sociology and the sociology of religion dealt with the rationalization, secularisation, and so called "disenchantment" which he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity.[18] In sociology, rationalization is the process whereby an increasing number of social actions become based on considerations of teleological efficiency or calculation rather than on motivations derived from morality, emotion, custom, or tradition. Rather than referring to what is genuinely "rational" or "logical", rationalization refers to a relentless quest for goals that might actually function to the detriment of a society. Rationalization is an ambivalent aspect of modernity, manifested especially in Western society - as a behaviour of the capitalist market, of rational administration in the state and bureaucracy, of the extension of modern science, and of the expansion of modern technology.[citation needed]

Weber's thought regarding the rationalizing and secularizing tendencies of modern Western society (sometimes described as the "Weber Thesis") would blend with Marxism to facilitate critical theory, particularly in the work of thinkers such as Jürgen Habermas (1929- ). Critical theorists, as antipositivists, are critical of the idea of a hierarchy of sciences or societies, particularly with respect to the sociological positivism originally set forth by Comte. Jürgen Habermas has critiqued the concept of pure instrumental rationality as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself. For theorists such as Zygmunt Bauman (1925- ), rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be most closely and regrettably associated with the events of the Holocaust.

Critique and impact on modern theories
Theories regarding "stages" of evolution were especially criticised as illusions. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between "primitive" and "civilized" (or "modern"), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilized societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific.

Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for power by the élites of society.

Thus modern sociocultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems:

- The theory was deeply ethnocentric—it makes heavy value judgments about different societies, with Western civilization seen as the most valuable.
- It assumed all cultures follow the same path or progression and have the same goals.
- It equated civilization with material culture (technology, cities, etc.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism
Postmodernism is a late-20th-century movement in the arts, architecture, and criticism that was a departure from modernism.[1][2] Postmodernism includes skeptical interpretations of culture, literature, art, philosophy, history, economics, architecture, fiction, and literary criticism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism
A notable characteristic of Modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc.[4] Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism[5][6][7] and makes use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody.

More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_rationality
Communicative rationality, or communicative reason, is a theory or set of theories which describes human rationality as a necessary outcome of successful communication.

According to the theory of communicative rationality, the potential for certain kinds of reason is inherent in communication itself. Building from this, Habermas has tried to formalize that potential in explicit terms.…
According to Habermas, the phenomena that need to be accounted for by the theory are the "intuitively mastered rules for reaching an understanding and conducting argumentation", possessed by subjects who are capable of speech and action…
  - fits Chomsky’s intuitive learning of language. This extends it to intuitive rationality.
 The goal is to transform this implicit "know-how" [often tacit knowledge] into explicit "know-that", i.e. knowledge, about how we conduct ourselves in the realm of "moral-practical" reasoning

The result of the theory is a conception of reason that Habermas sees as doing justice to the most important trends in twentieth century philosophy, while escaping the relativism which characterizes postmodernism, and also providing necessary standards for critical evaluation. (Habermas, 1992).

The modes of justification we use in our moral and political deliberations, and the ways we determine which claims of others are valid, are what matter most, and what determine whether we are being "rational". Hence the role that Habermas sees for communicative reason in formulating appropriate methods by which to conduct our moral and political discourse.

three kinds of (formal) reason:
According to Habermas, the "substantive" (i.e. formally & semantically integrated) rationality that characterized pre-modern worldviews has, since modern times, been emptied of its content and divided into three purely "formal" realms: (1) cognitive-instrumental reason; (2) moral-practical reason; and (3) aesthetic-expressive reason. The first type applies to the sciences, where experimentation & theorizing are geared towards a need to predict and control outcomes. The second type is at play in our moral and political deliberations (very broadly, answers to the question "how should I live?"), and the third type is typically found in the practices of art and literature. It is the second type which concerns Habermas.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_pragmatics
Universal pragmatics, more recently placed under the heading of formal pragmatics, is the philosophical study of the necessary conditions for reaching an understanding through communication.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_pragmatics#Communicative_action
Because Habermas developed it in order to have a normative and philosophical foundation for his critical social theory, most of the inroads into formal pragmatics start from sociology, specifically with what is called action theory. Action theory concerns the nature of human action, especially the manner in which collective actions are coordinated in a functioning society.

The coordination and integration of social action has been explained in many ways by many theories. Habermas has formulated a theory of communicative action.

Habermas makes a series of distinctions in the service of explaining social action. The first major differentiation he makes is between two social realms, the system and the lifeworld. These designate two distinct modes of social integration:

The kind of social integration accomplished in the system is accomplished through the functional integration of the consequences of actions. It bypasses the consciousness of individuals and does not depend upon their being oriented towards acting collectively. Economic and industrial systems are great examples, often producing complex forms of social integration and interdependence despite the openly competitive orientations of individuals.

The social integration accomplished in the lifeworld, by contrast, depends upon the coordination of action plans and the conscious action-orientations of individuals. It relies on processes of human interaction involving symbolic and cultural forms of meaning. More specifically, as Habermas maintains, the coordination of the lifeworld is accomplished through communicative action.

Thus, communicative action is an indispensable facet of society. It is at the heart of the lifeworld and is, Habermas claims, responsible for accomplishing several fundamental social functions: reaching understanding, cultural reproduction, coordinating action-plans, and socializing individuals.

However, Habermas is quick to note, different modes of interaction can (in some ways) facilitate these social functions and achieve integration within the lifeworld. This points towards the second key distinction Habermas makes, which differentiates communicative action from strategic action. The coordination of action plans, which constitutes the social integration of the lifeworld, can be accomplished either through consensus or influence.

Strategic action is action oriented towards success, while communicative action is action oriented towards understanding…Strategic action often involves the use of communicative actions to achieve the isolated intentions of individuals, manipulating shared understanding in the service of private interests. Thus, Habermas claims, strategic action is parasitic on communicative action, which means communicative action is the primary mode of linguistic interaction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action
communicative action is cooperative action undertaken by individuals based upon mutual deliberation and argumentation.

Communicative action for Habermas is possible given human capacity for rationality. This rationality, however, is "no longer tied to, and limited by, the subjectivistic and individualistic premises of modern philosophy and social theory."[1] Instead, Habermas situates rationality as a capacity inherent within language, especially in the form of argumentation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Habermas
In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a "representational" culture, where one party sought to "represent" itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects.[12] As an example of "representational" culture, Habermas argued that Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace.[12] Habermas identifies "representational" culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of Öffentlichkeit (the public sphere).[13] In the culture characterized by Öffentlichkeit, there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.[14] In Habermas's view, the growth in newspapers, journals, reading clubs, Masonic lodges, and coffeehouses in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of "representational" culture with Öffentlichkeit culture.[14] Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the Öffentlichkeit culture was its "critical" nature.[14] Unlike "representational" culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the Öffentlichkeit culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media.[14] Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of Öffentlichkeit culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe.[14] In his view, the French Revolution was in large part caused by the collapse of "representational" culture, and its replacement by Öffentlichkeit culture.[14] Though Habermas' main concern in The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.

According to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a commercial mass media, which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the "public sphere" into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded rational consensus.


The School of Life:
(11/24)
Max Weber (Sociology series)
One of the philosophers best able to explain the peculiar economic system we live under, Capitalism
bio:
witnessed industrial revolution (quite like China now), massive development, managerial elite replace aristocracy
1. Why does capitalism exist?
  - not because technology, but by a set of ideas, specifically those by protestant catholicism, more specifically, calvinism. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism:
    1.1 protestantism makes you feel guilty. Because ones deeds and evils add up until the final judgement, and there is no way to confess sins.
    1.2 god likes hard work - “the protestant work ethic”, guilt was diverted into an obsessions with hard work. There was more work and less festivals.
    1.3 all work is holy. Instead of clerics being prized as holy, all work in protestantism was considered holy, which added moral.
    1.4 it’s the community, not the family that counts - more community oriented as opposed to family-oriented catholicsm
    1.5. there aren’t miracles - “the disenchantment of the world”, which encouraged science

Marx argues that religion is an opium for capitalism, causing it. Weber argues religion didn’t turned into capitalism.

2. How do you develop capitalism around the world?
  - works in 35 countries, but not in the rest of the world.
  - aid is thrown to the other countries, but [some kind of ?] analysis shows this will never work because the problem isn’t a material one, it’s because they don’t feel anxious or guilty enough. They live for the moment, celebrate festivals, hope for miracles, etc.
    - [ahhhhh yessss]
  - Weber counseled those who wish to spread capitalism to focus on our equivalent of religion: culture. The IMF shouldn’t be giving money to aid Africa, it should give a new outlook, instill ideas, a culture of capitalism.
    - [also very good idea]

3. How can we change the world?
  - how political power operated: 1. traditional - kings and folklore 2. charismatic authority - heroic individual a la Napolean 3. beauracratic authority via knowledge
    - removing the leader of a bureaucracy almost never has the impact one hopes for, instead changes occur through the toils of the bureaucratic system.

Weber tells us how ideas are far more important than tools or money in changing nations, and what we associate with the external (material and forces) is dependent on our thoughts.

Emile Durkheim
best person to go to to question why capitalism makes us richer yet frequently more miserable.
bio:
Lived through industrial revolution, from agricultural to urban. He noticed capitalism is productive and liberating, but driving people to suicide (Suicide, a book). Noticed suicide correlated with capitalism.
1. individualism - the individual can choose what to do, where to belong, etc, as opposed to belonging to a family, where the family together makes much decisions. When things go wrong, only the individual is to blame, and it’s is a burden.
2. excessive hope - capitalism raises hope, but it also raises disappointment. People under capitalism may feel disappointed in their own failings, as opposed to just facing it as what it is: just a failure, nothing to be disappointed about.
3. we have too much freedom - without any sort of collectivism, “whatever works for you” means that people also don’t care about each other, feel no where to turn to
4. atheism - felt the best part of religion, the communal side, is now gone too. Capitalism doesn’t have anything to replace it with. Science doesn’t offer the same opportunity.
  - is science, art, socio-political progress not enough?
5. weakening of the nation and the family. By the time kids are adults, they are not expected to be close to their parents. Neither the nation or family provide a sense of belonging.

How to create new ways of belonging. How to alleviate the pressures off individuals. How to find a more correct balance of freedom and solidarity. How to create an ideology to not be so tough on ourselves for our failures and setbacks.
  - [very very important in the difference between American and Taiwan]

Marx (political theory)
capitalism’s most famous and ambitious critic
capitalism is going reformed, and marxist analysis is going to be a part of any answer
bio:
while he was in Germany, capitalism was still getting going, dominating the Western world
1. modern work is alienated
  - people must see themselves in their work, take for example a chair. Modern work is increasingly specialized. It makes production efficient, but makes one feel less about the contribution to the genuine needs of humanity.
  - what you do all day and what you ideally would do
2. modern work is insecure
  - workers can be replaced easily, as opposed to creating a community in which workers feel they belong
3. workers get paid while capitalists get rich
  - “primitive accumulation”
  - capitalism is theft and profit is exploitation
4. capitalism is very unstable
  - crisis are endemic to capitalism, crisis of abundance
  - understands that modern production can feed and house the world, which is infuriating but hopeful
  - should call unemployment freedom
5. capitalism is bad for capitalists
  - puts an economic strain on everyone, including capitalists, “commodity fetishism”, he wanted people to be free of financial constraint, putting value to things that have no value, as opposed to healthy relationships
  - there should be an option to enjoy leisure

ideology
  - the economic system colors the ideas we have, value-judgements, that poor people are bad, that having belongings is good, etc.
  - not just about hierarchy, but capitalist ideas teaches us all to be anxious, competitive, politically complacent, conformist,

utopia outlined in Communist Manifesto:
  - free public education, wealth distribution, steep tax grading, etc.
  - able to do anything without having a certain occupation: a hunter, fisherman, trader, etc.

He recognized the nature of disease [capitalism] although he had no idea how to cure it.

At this point of history we should all be Marxists in diagnosing the ills of capitalism, but need to go out and find the real cures.

Machiavelli (political theorist)
[my summary]
mostly just says to do what works, in his time, was to do morally bad things at the state level to preserve power over the state, meaning, public executions to instill fear, then resume normal stately things, balancing fear and good
[at the end of the video]
dealing with the world as it is, rather than how it should be
  - very good, as not all societies and people think at the same level

John Rawls (political theorist)
  - “veil of ignorance” thought experiment - would it be okay for you to be born from any random parent in the nation you live in? In his case, it was America, which is very unequal.

[skipped a few, perhaps including John Rushin and Morris]

Freud:
why our lives and relationships are full of confusion and pain, and why life is hard.
psychoanalysis
interpretation of dreams
pleasure principle - driven by it — rewards, and away from drudgery
reality principle
neurosis - repression of pleasure principle
id, ego, superego - driven by pleasure, balance between both, driven by reality principle (societal laws)
[silly ideas]
civilization and it’s discontent - society limiting pleasures causing neurosis
psychoanalysis - treated neurosis

(11/20)
Hegel
rose the academic tree to president of University of Berlin
terrible writing, lengthy
1. Important parts of ourselves can found in history
  - instead of looking at the past as primitive, one can look at any point in time as having wisdom
    - and we could and should go back in time to excavate ideas that have worked but disappeared. For example, going to Ancient Greece to learn what community is, which is lost in modern America, but should disregard the bad things, like war.
    - progress is not linear
2. Learn from ideas that you dislike
  - example, what was the human need in nationalism? Why do people choose to be poor or homeless?
3. Progress is messy
  - societies overcompensate for large mistakes (my example: 9/11)
  - it usually takes three moves: dialectic. The idea is to take the good qualities from both, synthesize it to make something new. [not just goldilocks?]
    - Examples: progress of state, sex form victorian to 60’s to now.
4. Art has a purpose
  - against art for art’s sake. “Art is the sensuous presentation of ideas”. Yes.
  - another reason is to for art to be sensuous enough to create an experience that impacts us
5. We need new institutions
  - in order for ideas to be active and effect, there needs to be new institutions. The state must eventually adapt new ideas somehow, with time and power, so that ideas are not just stuck in books.
    - artists and more active people do this in inner cities all of the time, but not on a state level.

Heiddeger
most incomprehensible German philosopher ever
Being and Time
rural life, walked, slept early, disliked television and much of modern pop things
spent much time in a hut near the woods
1. forgot to notice we’re alive. Being (life) vs The Nothing
2. unity of being, being is common
3. forget to be free and live for ourselves, thrown into a narrow culture, must get to a universal perspective, the goal to live for ourselves (as opposed to culture)
4. spend some time away at a graveyard
  - my thought, just get away from culture
  - from a comment “We should keep the thought of death foremost in our minds.﻿”
my conclusion: useless, skip this guy

from a comment, “Honestly, most of these philosophers have such a similar vision. Same idea, different terms. Heidegger practically conveys the same idea of absurdity that life possesses, as Sartre does. The idea of stepping away from the world as we know it and look at what we're actually doing. Which in term tells us to live for ourselves, cast aside the chains of society, exactly what Sartre says.”.

12 minute video:
much more detailed
  - the european languages focus on objects (subject / object) as opposed to being
  - probably other good things in there too…

Focault:
  - raised bourgeois, almost commit suicide, repressed homosexual thoughts detect from psychologist.
  - live abroad in Sweden, Poland, and Germany in his 20s where he felt his sexuality was less constrained
  - at age 27 read Nietzche “On the uses of History…” and became a philosophic historian
    - same idea as Hagel, bring out ideas from history for the present. Seems to be a direct continuation of Hegel actually, doing exactly what Hegel said to do.
  - Madness in Civilization book
    - depicted the differences of medical practices at different points in time, for example in the Renaissance the mad were seen as simply different, with a different kind of wisdom, and allowed to wonder freely, as opposed to 17th century in which people are imprisoned and “treated”
      - reminds me of how a person may be treated in Southeast Asia
      - it fails to see that differences exist in contemporary time between different societies
  - The Birth of the Clinic
    - 18th century medical practitioners “gazed” at people as a set of organs (information) as oppose to a whole person
  - Discipline and Punishment
     - power in punishment in the past was clear, people were publicly hanged, but now it is not so clear, people are “judged” then imprisoned or killed or even tortured (more barbaric than hanging) somewhere remote. In the past public executions led to riots, but now there aren’t any.
        - me: also a good observation. People should be punished in the public, just as killing animals should be done in the public. Everything should be done in the public so that people have the experience.
  - History of Sexuality
    - we live in the era of “science of sex”
      - again, pointing out that we have too much information
    - prefers the more erotic times, displayed in erotic art
contracted AIDS in a gay bar in San Francisco
should be wary of science and information, of it’s effects on society, in all forms of institutions
he looked at the history of various institutions and found better times in the past

Sociology / Adorno:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YGnPgtWhsw
  - quite and enlightening little video, especially of culture industry.
  - when he moved to the US, he was fascinated about consumerism and culture, similar to how I think in cities, of how people make decisions, especially of culture of capitalism.
    - 1. leisure time became toxic — entertainment (culture industry) — designed to distract and alter the will to alter political reality.
      - this might be a problem with the high work hours
    - 2. capitalism sells us things we don’t need. Desires are manufactured for us, although in reality, the things we desire cannot be manufactured: community, tenderness, etc.
    - 3. there are proto-fascists everywhere - people aren’t just political stereotypes — fascists, etc. — they are problems are psychological (problems in the mind), and the best way to fix this [especially on a mass scale] is to alter culture.
      - this is a simple good argument for altering culture to promote good values — community, etc.

Sociology / Alexis De Tocqueville
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzr3AOtFA8o&index=11&list=PLwxNMb28XmpdJpJzF2YRBnfmOva0HE0ZI
  - wrote Democracy in America after a 9 month journey in America
  - 1. democracy breeds materialism [value for money, not philosophical materialism]. Americans believed that through hard work it was possible to make a fortune, and to do so, it is entirely admirable and right, and items (perhaps even people) are judged so, which contradicts De Toxqueville’s (and normative) belief that money is not important.
   - 2. why american are so restlress in the midst of prosperity. ???
   - 3. the tyranny of the majority. Because democracy works on a majority basis, individuals are tyrannized.
  - 4. democracy turns us against authority. He was disturbed by the way people in the US deferred to professionals, too easily, and that individuals were not given a chance — mediocracy.
  - 5. democracy undermines freedom of mind. Americans thinking that their system is fair and just, simply gave up on critical thinking, and favored common sense. With commercialism, it was better not to talk about these things, so that one could sell things to everyone.
    - oh so true, which is why I love France’s intellectuals, especially in the form of film.
  - “it’s the price you pay and should be willing to pay when you ultimately give up authority to everyone”
    - indeed, the lack of critical thinking, down to philosophy, just trusting the systems, etc.

Eastern Philosophy / Matsuo Basho:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90-2Dg2CJdw&list=PLwxNMb28XmpdJpJzF2YRBnfmOva0HE0ZI&index=35
  - wrote poetry to guide wisdom in the form of haikus
  - became famous in the city, then melancholy,  shunned company, so often travelled by foot[***] and often lived in a small hut on the outskirts of a city
    - my life, but need to travel by foot, not motorcycle
  - didn’t believe in modern sense of art, “art for art’s sake”, he valued of bringing people to a certain state
  - instead of complex ideas, it valued awareness of current surroundings, nature, life, etc.
  - simple, light poetry
  - escape burden of self, circumstance, and unify with nature, until the lost-awareness of self
  - even during bad times, he doesn’t mind the bad things happening to him — fleas and lives biting, horse pissing nearby. Our lives don’t matter much in the big picture.
    - It’s seems like the subjective happy state of mind, perhaps even to escape responsibility, and focus on simple things.

all of the art things suck, except Andy Worhal, which is a bit enlightening:
  - he’s mostly interested in how celebrities function in the US, how art can make an impact in a capitalistic society.
  - he used mass-manufacturing of images to sell things, as coke manufactures soda in bottles, but made people aware of simple everyday things.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber#Dialogue_and_existence
Buber argued that human life consists of an oscillation between Ich‑Du [a real encounter between objects] and Ich‑Es [a counter between a person and a mental representation of an object], and that in fact Ich‑Du experiences are rather few and far between. In diagnosing the various perceived ills of modernity (e.g., isolation, dehumanization, etc.), Buber believed that the expansion of a purely analytic, material view of existence was at heart an advocation of Ich‑Es relations – even between human beings. Buber argued that this paradigm devalued not only existents, but the meaning of all existence.

11/15
I believe this is a note from my time in Beijing, thinking about Chinese art:

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_arts
The distinction between the decorative and the fine arts has essentially arisen from the post-Renaissance art of the West, where the distinction is for the most part meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most highly regarded works – or even all works – include those in decorative media. For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, as does the art of many traditional cultures. The distinction between decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating Chinese art, and neither is it for understanding Early Medieval art in Europe. In that period in Europe, fine arts such as manuscript illuminationand monumental sculpture existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in goldsmith work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as ivory carving.

They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for mosaic, which for this period must be viewed as a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be seen as decorative.
  - the progression of aesthetic

Modern understanding of the art of many cultures tends to be distorted by the modern privileging of fine art media over others, as well as the very different survival rates of works in different media.

And

The promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as Vasari promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the High Renaissance, that placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as Michelangelo, Raphael or Leonardo da Vinci.

Works in metal, above all in precious metals, are liable to be "recycled" as soon as they fall from fashion, and were often used by owners as repositories of wealth, to be melted down when extra money was needed. Illuminated manuscripts have a much higher survival rate, especially in the hands of the church, as there was little value in the materials and they were easy to store.
 - decorative arts are more likely to disappear

Middle Ages had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques had been highly valued.
 - lesser art

In China both approaches had co-existed for many centuries.
---

Asian aesthetic writing is generally consistent in stating the goal of ink and wash painting is not simply to reproduce the appearance of the subject, but to capture its spirit.

Ivan Illich wiki:

Bio:
 In 1951, he "signed up to become a parish priest in one of New York’s poorest neighborhoods—Washington Heights, on the northern tip of Manhattan, then a barrio of fresh-off-the-airplane Puerto Rican immigrants.
  - experience in poor urban area in NY, found solace with Puerto Rican immigrants

 In 1959, he traveled throughout South America on foot and by bus.
  - travelled to experience other societies, like the origin of Puerto Rican good ethics

In 1961, Illich founded the Centro Intercultural de Documentación (CIDOC, or Intercultural Documentation Center) at Cuernavaca in Mexico, ostensibly a research center offering language courses to missionaries from North America and volunteers of the Alliance for Progress program[5] initiated by John F. Kennedy. His real intent was to document the participation of the Vatican in the "modern development" of the so-called Third World…Throughout the late ’60s and early ’70s, CIDOC was part language school and part free university for intellectual hippies from all over the Americas
 - more research and critical philosophy
…
At the CIDOC, "Illich was able to develop his potent and highly influential critique of Third World development schemes and their fresh-faced agents: Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, and countless other missionary efforts bankrolled and organized by wealthy nations, foundations, and religious groups."

In the 1970s, Illich was popular among leftist intellectuals in France, his thesis having been discussed in particular by André Gorz. However, his influence declined after the 1981 election of François Mitterrand as Illich was considered too pessimistic at a time when the French Left took control of the government.
  - French intellectuals found him interesting, but he’s always critical

In the 1980s and beyond, Illich traveled extensively, mainly splitting his time between the United States, Mexico, and Germany. He held an appointment as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy, Science, Technology and Society at Penn State. He also taught at the University of Bremen and University of Hagen.
  - philosophy, tech, science, and society, or more broadly, the development of society. Participated in the institutions he was critical of, yet, he probably needed money and is most interested in this kind of critical work.

During his last days of his life he admitted that he was greatly influenced by one of the Indian economists and adviser to M.K. Gandhi, J.C. Kumarappa, most notably, his book, Economy of Permanence.
  - Asian economy influences

During his later 20 years, he suffered from a cancerous growth on his face that, in accordance with his critique of professionalized medicine, was treated with non-traditional methods, such as meditation and yoga.[citation needed] In the last few years, he regularly smoked opium to deal with the pain caused by this tumor.[citation needed] At an early stage, he consulted a doctor—who told him he would live only for 3 months—about having the tumor removed, but was told that there was too great a chance of losing his ability to speak, and so he lived with the tumor as best he could. He called it "my mortality."
  - wild, his philosophy against medicine worked in his favor at the end, living 19 more years than expected

Deschooling Society
The book that brought Ivan Illich to public attention was Deschooling Society (1971), a radical critical discourse on education as practised in "modern" economies. Giving examples of what he regards as the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education, Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:

Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. [*****] We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.
— Ivan Illich, [1]

The last sentence makes clear what the title suggests—that the institutionalization of education tends towards the institutionalization of society and that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.

The book is more than a critique—it contains suggestions for a reinvention of learning throughout society and lifetime. Particularly striking is his call (in 1971) for the use of advanced technology to support "learning webs."

The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity.
— Ivan Illich

Tools for Conviviality
Tools for Conviviality (1973) was published only two years after Deschooling Society. In this new work Illich generalized the themes that he had previously applied to the field of education: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of technocratic elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that "[e]lite professional groups . . . have come to exert a 'radical monopoly' on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a 'war on subsistence' that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but 'modernized poverty,' dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts."[2] Illich proposed that we should "invert the present deep structure of tools" in order to "give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency."

Counterproductivity:
The main notion of Ivan Illich is the concept of counterproductivity: when institutions of modern industrial society impede their purported aims. For example, Ivan Illich calculated that, in America in the 1970s, if you add the time spent to work to earn the money to buy a car, the time spent in the car (including traffic jam), the time spent in the health care industry because of a car crash, the time spent in the oil industry to fuel cars ...etc., and you divide the number of kilometres traveled per year by that, you obtain the following calculation: 10000 km per year per person divided by 1600 hours per year per American equals 6 km per hour. So the real speed of a car would be about 3.7 miles per hour.

Diseconomy:
Specific diseconomy is another term Illich used, as a measure of the degree of institutional counterproductivity that is occurring—referring to the exact degree to which, for example, the medical industry induces illness, educational institutions induce ignorance, the judicial system perpetuates injustice, or national defense may make a nation less secure. When specific diseconomy is on the increase, this means an institution or industry is increasingly counterproductive to its original intentions.

Radical Monopoly:
He invented the concept of radical monopoly: when a technical medium is or appears to be more effective, it creates a monopoly which denies access to other media. The mandatory consumption of a medium which uses a lot of energy (for example motorised transportation) narrows the fruition of use value (innate transit ability).

Conviviality:
Illich worked to open new possibilities. Illich devotes a chapter of Deschooling Society to the proposal to the Rebirth of Epimethean Man.[20] He argued that we need convivial tools as opposed to machines. A tool may have many applications, some very different from its original intended use. A tool may be thought of as an expression of its user. The opposite of this is the machine, where humans become its servants, their role consisting only of running the machine for a single purpose.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_metaphysics_of_Quality
The Metaphysics of Quality originated with Pirsig's college studies as a biochemistry student at the University of Minnesota. He describes in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance that as he studied, he found the number of rational hypotheses for any given phenomenon appeared to be unlimited. It seemed to him this would seriously undermine the validity of the scientific method. His studies began to suffer as he pondered the question and eventually he was expelled from the university.

After spending some time in Korea as a soldier, Pirsig concluded that Oriental philosophy was a better place to search for ultimate answers. On his return home from Korea, Pirsig read F. S. C. Northrop's book The Meeting of East and West which related Western culture to the culture of East Asia in a systematic way. In 1950, Pirsig continued his philosophical studies at Banaras Hindu University, where he came across the Sanskrit doctrine of Tat tvam asi—in his words, "Thou art that, which asserts that everything you think you are (Subjective), and everything you think you perceive (Objective), are undivided. To fully realize this lack of division is to become enlightened." The nature of mystical experience plays an underlying role throughout his work.
…
Dynamic Quality
Dynamic quality cannot be defined. It can only be understood intellectually through the use of analogy. It can be described as the force of change in the universe; when an aspect of quality becomes habitual or customary, it becomes static. Pirsig calls dynamic quality "the pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality" because it can be recognized before it can be conceptualized. This is why the dynamic beauty of a piece of music can be recognized before a static analysis explaining why the music is beautiful can be constructed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lila:_An_Inquiry_into_Morals
Another theme analyzed using the Metaphysics of Quality is the interaction between intellectual and social patterns. Pirsig states that until the end of the Victorian era, social patterns dominated the conduct of members of the American culture. In the aftermath of World War I, intellectual patterns and the scientific method acceded to that position, becoming responsible for directing the nation's goals and actions. The later occurrences of fascism are seen as an anti-intellectual struggle to return social patterns to the dominant position. The hippie movement, having perceived the flaws inherent in both social and intellectual patterns, sought to transcend them, but failed to provide a stable replacement, degenerating instead into lower level biological patterns as noted in its calls for free love.

the common thread that ties RTJ2 with some of the other widely-celebrated albums of 2014—Benji, To Be Kind, and Beyoncé—is that each is an example of a seasoned artist using their financial and artistic capital to take control of the means of production and distribution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchism
At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs." and so "Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisanal socialism ... while communist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan
Artisans were the dominant producers of consumer products prior to the Industrial Revolution

Artisans were divided into two distinct groups: those who operated their own businesses and those who did not.

Shokunin is a Japanese word for "artisan" or "craftsman", which also implies a pride in one's own work.
  - the difference between Industrial goods and artisan goods is that one is aware that somebody made it, which makes it seem more meaningful, even though a factory requires a lot of work to create and maintain, and a lot of people

He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s;[4] his approach in film conventions, politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave. Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references, several of his films expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy.[4][5]

Since the New Wave, his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about representation and human conflict from a humanist, and a Marxist perspective

The term "film club" appears for the first time in April 1907 with the creation of Edmond Benoit-Lévy's "Film club." Located at the 5 Montmartre boulevard in Paris, it is to preserve and place at the disposal of its members all the cinematographic documents and productions existing. It is also equipped with a room of projection.
  - public space used for film-making interests

François Truffaut has depicted vividly Bazin's engagement in the cinéclub-movement:

"During the first days of our friendship - it was about 1947 - I had the chance of accompanying him at his film presentations and observing him who he projected two short films of Chaplin - first in a dominican monastery and two days later to the workers in a metal factory in their short break between their lunch and their return to their workbenches. At both occasions he managed to inspire his audience and to draw everybody into the discussion."

 Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen's playing style: "Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his “nettlesomeness,” to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response."[
  - hah

 Vladimir Kramnik attributed much of Carlsen's success against other top players to his "excellent physical shape" and his ability to avoid "psychological lapses", which enables him to maintain a high standard of play over long games and at the end of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped.
  - physical energy, indeed a human problem

Polgár has spoken of appreciating the psychological aspect of chess. She has stated preferring to learn an opponent's style so she can play intentionally against him rather than playing "objective" chess.[217] In her 2002 victory over Kasparov, she deliberately chose a line Kasparov used against Vladimir Kramnik, employing the strategy of forcing the opponent to "play against himself". Kasparov's response was inadequate and he soon found himself in an inferior position.[137] In an interview regarding playing against computers she said, "Chess is 30 to 40% psychology. You don't have this when you play a computer. I can't confuse it."[
  - the limits of human minds

In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer explained his reasons for advocating Fischerandom Chess:[606]

In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not know as much as I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn’t do well. They’d get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don’t like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...

After the game, the friend joked: "You are good at chess, but I'm a good cook." Judit replied: "Do you cook without looking at the stove?"

Claude Shannon attended a philosophy class at the University of Michigan which introduced him to Boole's studies. Shannon recognised that Boole's work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant. In 1937 Shannon went on to write a master's thesis, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in which he showed how Boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical relays then used in telephone routing switches. He also proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems. Employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic digital computers…Hence, Boolean algebra became the foundation of practical digital circuit design; and Boole, via Shannon and Shestakov, provided the theoretical grounding for the Information Age.

  - “In 1816, Byron visited San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice, where he acquainted himself with Armenian culture with the help of the abbots belonging to the Mechitarist Order. With the help of Father H. Avgerian, he learned the Armenian language,[41] and attended many seminars about language and history. He co-authored English Grammar and Armenian (Angleren yev hayeren grakanutyun) in 1817, and Armenian Grammar and English (Hayeren yev angleren grakanutyun) in 1819, where he included quotations from classical and modern Armenian.[41]

Byron later participated in the compilation of the English Armenian dictionary (Barraran angleren yev hayeren, 1821) and wrote the preface in which he explained the relationship of the Armenians with and the oppression of the Turkish "pashas" and the Persian satraps, and their struggle of liberation. His two main translations are the Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, two chapters of Movses Khorenatsi's History of Armenia and sections of Nerses of Lambron's Orations.[42]

His fascination was so great that he even considered a replacement of the Cain story of the Bible with that of the legend of Armenian patriarch Haik.[42] He may be credited with the birth of Armenology and its propagation.[42] His profound lyricism and ideological courage has inspired many Armenian poets, the likes of Ghevond Alishan, Smbat Shahaziz, Hovhannes Tumanyan, Ruben Vorberian and others.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provo_(movement)
Provo was a Dutch counterculture movement in the mid-1960s that focused on provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait.

Provo realises that it will lose in the end, but it cannot pass up the chance to make at least one more heartfelt attempt to provoke society. Provo regards anarchy as the inspirational source of resistance. Provo wants to revive anarchy and teach it to the young. Provo is an image.”

Bernhard de Vries states that the Provos comprised four groups of people:
"The happeners": those managing happenings in Amsterdam and Antwerp, combining non-violence with absurd humour to provoke the police. The police were regarded as “essential non-creative elements for a successful happening” and “co-happeners”.
"The beatniks and hipsters".
"The thinkers": those publishing Provo ideas in magazines and pamphlets, including Provo, Revo, Eindelijk, and University of Amsterdam student weekly Propria Cures.
"The activists" or the “street Provos” who engaged in direct action with the intent to influence public opinion.[1]

Zizek! (film):

I had a problem watching any other film, so I decided to listen to the film zizek!.

Zizek’s aim, in his work, is to combine a Marxist critique of capitalism with a psychoanalytically informed unmasking of the ways in which capitalism works upon the public imagination.

Never wanted to minimize the theory, which is why he never did politics — it takes time.

Was candidate for president in Slovenia in 1990!

He definitely talks too much, but that’s why he’s written so many books.

“They do not know it, but they are doing it.” - definition of ideology by Marx’s Capital.

The fundamental level of ideology, however, is not of an illusion masking the real state of things but that an [unconscious] fantasy structuring our social reality itself.
 
Ideology:
After the conference (book, film, whatever), people continue with the ideological lives.

Language, language-game, etc. Beginning of philosophy kind of thing.

Today people are afraid to commit to anything: love, work, etc. Afraid of compromise, committing to an ideology.

Age 27, no job, parents supported him. He was unable to get a job, and sometimes unable to publish books.

Lacan combined “returned Freud” psychoanalyses with other disciplines, especially structured linguistics and modern philosophy.

Not enough words to tell the truth, reality.

Ideology isn’t Marxism, Christian, liberal, etc. Ideological propositions do not define us. Humans are more complex.

philosophy:
Lacan is obscure, but Zizek found his logic useful, not his style.

Has a kid, and is great with him! Possibly learns a lot from his son.

The purpose of philosophy is not to solve problems but to falsify(?) them. To show what we experience a problem is, is false.

A traditional psychoanalysts proposition is getting rid of inhibitions to enjoy, but the problem is to get rid of the injunction to enjoyment.

psychoanalysis:
If we subtract the surplus we lose enjoyment itself, just as capitalism, which can survive only by incessantly revolutionizing its own material conditions, ceases to exist if it stays the same, achieves an internal balance.

surplus value - the cause which sets in motion the capitalist process of production

surplus enjoyment - the object cause of desire
  - disagree, not just an object, an experience!
  - from The Sublime Object of Ideology

Why Lacan and Marx? Because Lacan is perfect to describe late capitalism.

Politics?:
What left wants — to revolutionize yet still be prosperous.

Zizek’s canon: Sublime Object, something Negative, Tickly Subject, Parallax View, Hagel

Impossible to write, have to trick self, write ideas, then edit it.

overall:
Not so good. More about Zizek’s everyday life, but perhaps I wasn’t in an observational mood, or perhaps I’m not living enough. I do like his subject though, Marx and Lacan, or critique of capitalism and psychoanalysis. Part economy, part ideology, part cognitive bias.

9/22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HolismSocial scientist and physician Nicholas A. Christakis explains that "for the last few centuries, the Cartesian project in science has been to break matter down into ever smaller bits, in the pursuit of understanding. And this works, to some extent... but putting things back together in order to understand them is harder, and typically comes later in the development of a scientist or in the development of science."holistic sciences are anthropology, ecology, and economics.

Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragments_of_an_Anarchist_Anthropology
Reasons for the nonexistence of anarchist anthropology:
Graeber offers several possibilities why anthropologists are reluctant to come out and make normative judgments and proposals: "In many ways, anthropology seems a discipline terrified of its own potential. It is, for example, the only discipline in a position to make generalizations about humanity as a whole—since it is the only discipline that actually takes all of humanity into account, and is familiar with all the anomalous cases." (p. 96) Anthropologists, Graeber writes, may be also simply afraid of being dismissed as "utopian."

Part of the problem, Graeber claims, is that traditionally, academics on the radical left have gravitated toward the more "High Theory"-oriented Marxism (Karl Marx himself was a PhD) rather than the more practice-oriented anarchism. Graeber further claims: "1. Marxism has tended to be a theoretical or analytical discourse about revolutionary strategy. 2. Anarchism has tended to be an ethical discourse about revolutionary practice." (p. 6)

Revolution through non-confrontation:
The Tsimihety, rejecting all governmental authority and organizing their society along very egalitarian lines, were able to continue their autonomy and culture for decades on end, up to the present, not by confronting the government, but by retreating. Graeber writes,

"To this day they have maintained a reputation as masters of evasion: under the French, administrators would complain that they could send delegations to arrange for labor to build a road near a Tsimihety village, negotiate the terms with apparently cooperative elders, and return with the equipment a week later only to discover the village entirely abandoned—every single inhabitant had moved in with some relative in another part of the country." (p. 55)

Aspects of an anarchist anthropology:
In particular, Graeber suggests several areas a hypothetical anarchist anthropology would need to tackle, and in the book elaborates on each point briefly:

A theory of the state
A theory of political entities that are not states
Yet another theory of capitalism
Power/ignorance, or power/stupidity (Graeber explores a possible theory of the relation of power not with knowledge, but with ignorance and stupidity, in explicit opposition to Foucault's theories of power and knowledge. "Because violence, particularly structural violence, where all the power is on one side, creates ignorance." (p. 72))
An ecology of voluntary associations*
A theory of political happiness
Hierarchy
Suffering and pleasure: on the privatization of desire
One or several theories of alienation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Chimpanzee
Part two considers sexual dimorphism in mammals, and particularly humans, and the mechanics of sexual selection. It considers how across species, females are more careful in selecting their mates than males (they invest far more energy into each offspring). This determines much of human behaviour: how we pick our mates, and how we organize society and child nurturing systems, leading to differing social structures in cultures such as Papua New Guinea, Kerala, and the Christian West.
  - good idea, from difference in genes to roles in society (cultures)

It also considers questions of longevity – the previous generation dies because its biological clock shuts down metabolism and repair as to divert investment from the parent individual to that of the offspring.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor
In cognitive linguistics, conceptual metaphor, or cognitive metaphor, refers to the understanding of one idea, or conceptual domain, in terms of another. An example of this is the understanding of quantity in terms of directionality (e.g. "the prices are rising").
…
There are two main roles for the conceptual domains posited in conceptual metaphors:

Source domain: the conceptual domain from which we draw metaphorical expressions (e.g., love is a journey).
Target domain: the conceptual domain that we try to understand (e.g., love is a journey).
A mapping is the systematic set of correspondences that exist between constituent elements of the source and the target domain. 
…
A primary tenet of this theory is that metaphors are matter of thought and not merely of language: hence, the term conceptual metaphor. The metaphor may seem to consist of words or other linguistic expressions that come from the terminology of the more concrete conceptual domain, but conceptual metaphors underlie a system of related metaphorical expressions that appear on the linguistic surface. Similarly, the mappings of a conceptual metaphor are themselves motivated by image schemas which are pre-linguistic schemas concerning space, time, moving, controlling, and other core elements of embodied human experience.
  - yes.

Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all.

"how is the success of science to be explained?"

An unobservable (also called impalpable) is an entity whose existence, nature, properties, qualities or relations are not directly observable by humans. In philosophy of science typical examples of "unobservables" are atomic particles, the force of gravity, causation and beliefs or desires.[citation needed] However, some philosophers (ex. George Berkeley) also characterize all objects — trees, tables, other minds, microbiological things and so on to which humans ascribe as the thing causing their perception — as unobservable.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobservable

The problem of induction is the philosophical question of whether inductive reasoning leads to knowledge understood in the classic philosophical sense.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction

Inductive reasoning (as opposed to deductive reasoning or abductive reasoning) is reasoning in which the premises seek to supply strong evidence for (not absolute proof of) the truth of the conclusion. While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable, based upon the evidence given.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning

Deductive reasoning, also deductive logic or logical deduction or, informally, "top-down" logic,[1] is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.[2] It differs from inductive reasoning or abductive reasoning.
…
Deductive reasoning links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.
…
An example of a deductive argument:
All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning

Unlike deductive arguments, inductive reasoning allows for the possibility that the conclusion is false, even if all of the premises are true.[4] Instead of being valid or invalid, inductive arguments are either strong or weak, which describes how probable it is that the conclusion is true.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning

Distinguishing between science and non-science is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should psychoanalysis be considered science? How about so-called creation science, the inflationary multiverse hypothesis, or macroeconomics? Karl Popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science.

Early attempts by the logical positivists grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.[4] Popper argued that the central property of science is falsifiability. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.
  — mmmmmmmm, now it makes sense for Popper’s fame

Observation inseparable from theory
All observation involves both perception and cognition. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.

Instrumentalism is one of a multitude of modern schools of thought created by scientists and philosophers throughout the 20th century. Its premises and practices were most clearly and persuasively stated by two philosophers—John Dewey (1859-1952) and Karl Popper (1902-1994). Independently, they defined the school quite similarly, but their judgments 
of it were irreconcilable.
…
1) Theories are instruments, tools-of-the-trade of thinking.
  - Instrumentalism endorses "the interpretation of scientific theories as practical instruments or tools for such purposes as the prediction of impending events."
2) Theories are tested by consequences, applying the instrumental criterion of judgment.
  - "The verification of a theory … is carried on by the observation of particular facts.
3) Theory-development requires inductive reasoning, basing general statements on limited observations.
3.1)An empirical philosopher must "… first find particular cases from which he then generalizes."
3.2) I am "… an opponent of the widely accepted dogma of inductivism—of the view that science starts from observation and proceeds, by induction, to generalizations, and ultimately to theories."
4) There are no realities beyond what can be known using instrumental theories.
4.1)"It is therefore in submitting conceptions to the control of experience … that one finds examples of what is called truth."
4.2)“A representation of instrumentalism can be obtained … by omitting … the universe of the realities behind the various appearances."

3.2 further explained
According to a widely accepted view—to be opposed in this book—the empirical sciences can be characterized by the fact that they use "inductive methods", as they are called. ...
It is usual to call an inference "inductive" if it passes from singular statements (sometimes also called "particular" statements), such as the results of observations or experiments, to universal statements, such as hypotheses or theories...
Now, it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we are justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white.

belief from inductive to deductive:
Popper rejected inductive reasoning in favor of deductive reasoning because he maintained that the former could not achieve logical form. Deduction can move from a self-evident universal statement, such as "All men are mortal", to true singular statements that every individual human is mortal, because the universal statement already embraces all singulars. But there can be no principle by which a singular statement can justify a universal, because no singular statement can report observing "all" of any kind.
…
Instrumentalism is often identified with other schools which share some of these premises: positivism, pragmatism, operationalism, behaviorism, anti-realism, empiricism, consequentialism.
…

against logical atomism:
The question of how it happens that a new idea occurs to a man—whether it be a musical theme, a dramatic conflict, or a scientific theory—may be of great interest to empirical psychology; but it is irrelevant to the logical analysis of scientific knowledge. The latter is concerned not with questions of fact ... but only with question of justification or validity ...

fun science:
I can therefore gladly admit that falsificationists like myself much prefer an attempt to solve an interesting problem by a bold conjecture, even ( and especially) if it soon turns out to be false, to any recital of a sequence of irrelevant truisms
…
Summing up we may say that instrumentalism is unable to account for the importance to pure science of testing severely even the most remote implications of its theories, since it is unable to account for the pure scientist's interest in truth and falsity. In contrast to the highly critical attitude requisite in the pure scientist,the attitude of instrumentalism (like that of applied science) is one of complacency at the success of applications.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism

Thomas Kuhn:
For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by, but not ultimately determined by, logical processes. An individual's choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. In the case of a general acceptance of one paradigm or another, Kuhn believed that it represented the consensus of the community of scientists. Acceptance or rejection of some paradigm is, he argued, a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism.[36] According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift will occur when a significant number of observational anomalies in the old paradigm have made the new paradigm more useful. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

Coherentism:
In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations… An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.

In fact, according to the Duhem-Quine thesis, after Pierre Duhem and Willard Van Orman Quine, it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.

One consequence of the Duhem-Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ad hoc hypotheses.

philosophy of social science:
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the social sciences, such as sociology, anthropology, and political science. Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the natural sciences, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the ontological significance of structure and agency.

The French philosopher, Auguste Comte (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of positivism in The Course in Positivist Philosophy

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research. Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism. Positivism has also been espoused by 'technocrats' who believe in the inevitability of social progress through science and technology.

The positivist perspective has been associated with 'scientism'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer bias and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, and new philosophical movements such as critical realism and neopragmatism. The philosopher-sociologist Jürgen Habermas has critiqued pure instrumental rationality as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_realism_(philosophy_of_the_social_sciences)
Critical realism is a philosophical approach associated with Roy Bhaskar that combines a general philosophy of science (transcendental realism) with a philosophy of social science (critical naturalism) to describe an interface between the natural and social worlds.

Bhaskar developed a general philosophy of science that he described as transcendental realism, and a special philosophy of the human sciences that he called critical naturalism. The two terms were combined by other authors to form the umbrella term critical realism.

transcendental realism:
Transcendental realism attempts to establish that in order for scientific investigation to take place, the object of that investigation must have real, manipulable, internal mechanisms that can be actualised to produce particular outcomes. This is what we do when we conduct experiments. This stands in contrast to empiricist scientists' claim that all scientists can do is observe the relationship between cause and effect and impose meaning. Whilst empiricism, and positivism more generally, locate causal relationships at the level of events, Critical Realism locates them at the level of the generative mechanism, arguing that causal relationships are irreducible to empirical constant conjunctions of David Hume's doctrine; in other words, a constant conjunctive relationship between events is neither sufficient nor even necessary to establish a causal relationship.

construct:
The implication of this is that science should be understood as an ongoing process in which scientists improve the concepts they use to understand the mechanisms that they study. It should not, in contrast to the claim of empiricists, be about the identification of a coincidence between a postulated independent variable and dependent variable. Positivism/falsification[clarification needed] are also rejected due to the observation that it is highly plausible that a mechanism will exist but either a) go unactivated, b) be activated, but not perceived, or c) be activated, but counteracted by other mechanisms, which results in its having unpredictable effects. Thus, non-realisation of a posited mechanism cannot (in contrast to the claim of positivists) be taken to signify its non-existence.

critical naturalism (social science):
Critical naturalism argues that the transcendental realist model of science is equally applicable to both the physical and the human worlds. However, when we study the human world we are studying something fundamentally different from the physical world and must therefore adapt our strategy to studying it. Critical naturalism therefore prescribes social scientific method which seeks to identify the mechanisms producing social events, but with a recognition that these are in a much greater state of flux than those of the physical world (as human structures change much more readily than those of, say, a leaf). In particular, we must understand that human agency is made possible by social structures that themselves require the reproduction of certain actions/pre-conditions. Further, the individuals that inhabit these social structures are capable of consciously reflecting upon, and changing, the actions that produce them—a practice that is in part facilitated by social scientific research.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Negri
Born in Padua, he became a political philosophy professor in his hometown university. Negri founded the Potere Operaio (Worker Power) group in 1969 and was a leading member of Autonomia Operaia.[1] As one of the most popular theorists of Autonomism, he has published hugely influential books urging "revolutionary consciousness."

Negri fled to France where, protected by the Mitterrand doctrine, he taught at the Université de Vincennes (Paris-VIII) and the Collège International de philosophie, along with Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze.[1] In 1997, after a plea-bargain that reduced his prison time from 30 to 13 years,[4] he returned to Italy to serve the end of his sentence. Many of his most influential books were published while he was behind bars.

early years:
although the father died when Negri was two years old, his political engagement made Negri familiar with Marxism from an early age. He began his career as a militant in the 1950s with the activist Roman Catholic youth organization Gioventú Italiana di Azione Cattolica (GIAC). Negri became a communist in 1953–54 when he worked at a kibbutz in Israel for a year. The kibbutz was organised according to ideas of Zionist socialism and all the members were Jewish communists.[5] He joined the Italian Socialist Party in 1956 and remained a member until 1963, while at the same time becoming more and more engaged throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in Marxist movements.

He had a quick academic career at the University of Padua and was promoted to full professor at a young age in the field of "dottrina dello Stato" (State theory), a peculiarly Italian field that deals with juridical and constitutional theory.

In the early 1960s Negri joined the editorial group of Quaderni Rossi, a journal that represented the intellectual rebirth of Marxism in Italy outside the realm of the communist party.

In 1969, together with Oreste Scalzone and Franco Piperno, Negri was one of the founders of the group Potere Operaio (Workers' Power) and the Operaismo (workerist) Communist movement. Potere Operaio disbanded in 1973 and gave rise to the Autonomia Operaia Organizzata (Organised Workers' Autonomy) movement.

political thought and writing:
Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace. The journal Quaderni Rossi ("Red Notebooks"), produced between 1961 and 1965, and its successor Classe Operaia ("Working Class"), produced between 1963 and 1966, were also influential in the development of early autonomism. Both were founded by Antonio Negri and Mario Tronti.

Today, Antonio Negri is best known as the co-author, with Michael Hardt, of the controversial Marxist-inspired treatise Empire (2000).[8]

In 2009 Negri completed the book Commonwealth, the final in a trilogy that began in 2000 with Empire and continued with Multitude in 2004, co-authored with Michael Hardt.[1][14]

Since Commonwealth, he has written multiple notable articles on the Arab Spring and Occupy movements along with other social issues.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_humanism
is a branch of Marxism that primarily focuses on Marx's earlier writings, especially the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 in which Marx espoused his theory of alienation, as opposed to his later works, which are considered to be concerned more with his structural conception of capitalist society.

The early Marx, influenced by Feuerbach's humanistic inversion of Hegelian idealism, articulated a concept of species-being, according to which man's essential nature is that of a free producer, freely reproducing their own conditions of life. However, under capitalism individuals are alienated from their productive activity insofar as they are compelled to sell their labor-power as a commodity to a capitalist; their sensuous life-activity, or labor, thus appears to them as something objective, a commodity to be bought and sold like any other. To overcome alienation and allow man to realize his species-being, therefore, the wage-labor system itself must be transcended, and the separation of the laborer from the means of labor abolished.

refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism

Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the Grundrisse and The Civil War in France;[2] emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation.[3] Along with anarchism, Libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism.

Situationist International*

Autonomism*

Communization*
communism as a particular activity and process.

the 1975 Pamphlet A World Without Money states: “insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself.”

Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with "the revolution" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities – from squatting and setting up communes to simply "sharing" – that would typically be understood as "pre-revolutionary".[9] From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of "dropping-out" or, as Tiqqun put it, "desertion" — setting up spaces and practices that are held to be partially autonomous from capitalism — is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.

"More recently its ideas have been elaborated and extended in discussions with like-minded groups including the English language Endnotes and the Swedish journal Riff Raff. Together these collectives have recently collaborated to produce Sic – an international journal of communisation (issue number one was published in 2011)."

is an approach to geography that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting" around urban environments. It has links to the Situationist International.

The study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."

Another definition is "a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities... just about anything that takes pedestrians off their predictable paths and jolts them into a new awareness of the urban landscape.
  - a life goal of mine

In "Formulary for a New Urbanism", Chtcheglov had written "Architecture is the simplest means of articulating time and space, of modulating reality, of engendering dreams"

When freedom is practiced in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself. The ambiance of play is by nature unstable. At any moment, "ordinary life" may prevail once again. The geographical limitation of play is even more striking than its temporal limitation. Every game takes place within the boundaries of its own spatial domain
  - Yessss

The atmosphere of a few places gave us a few intimations of the future powers of an architecture that it would be necessary to create in order to provide the setting for less mediocre games.
  - urban design for playfulness

People can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is animated. Obstacles were everywhere. And they were all interrelated, maintaining a unified reign of poverty.

Kuhn believed that it represented the consensus of the community of scientists. Acceptance or rejection of some paradigm is, he argued, a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism.[36] According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift will occur when a significant number of observational anomalies in the old paradigm have made the new paradigm more useful.

Current Approaches:

Axiomatic assumptions:
Some thinkers seek to articulate axiomatic assumptions on which science may be based, a form of foundationalism. Proponents argue that these assumptions are reasonable and necessary for practicing science. For instance, Hugh Gauch argues that science presupposes that "the physical world is orderly and comprehensible.”

To begin form the beginning is a quote from Lennin who in turn is similar to Beckett’s “try again, fail again, fail better”.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger
Being and Time (1927), is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century.[7] In it and later works, Heidegger maintained that one's way of questioning defines one's nature. He argued that Western thinking had lost sight of being, and that by people finding themselves as "always already" moving within ontological presuppositions, they lose touch with their grasp of being and its truth thus becomes "muddled".[8] As a solution to this condition, Heidegger advocated a change in focus from ontologies based on ontic determinants to the fundamental ontological elucidation of being-in-the-world in general, allowing it to reveal, or "unconceal" itself as concealment.

a sense of historical actuality and immediacy;
political commitment to progressive social change;
authentic on-location shooting as opposed to the artificial studio;
a rejection of classical Hollywood acting styles; extensive use of non-professional actors as much as possible;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ideas
Michel Foucault rejects the idea of the traditional way historians go about writing, which is a narrative. He believed that most historians preferred to write about long periods of time instead of digging deeper into a more specific history.[8] Foucault argues that historians should reveal historical descriptions through different perspectives. This is where he comes up with the term “archaeology” for his method of historical writing. His historical method differs from the traditional sense of historical writing and is divided up into four different ideas.

The first is that “archeology” seeks to define the history through philosophical means, which is to say the discourse between thought, representation, and themes. The second is that “archaeology,” the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines. The third idea is that “archaeology” does not seek to grasp the moment that history at which the individual and the social are inverted into one another. And finally the fourth point is that “archaeology” does not seek the truth of history, rather it seeks the discourse in it

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archaeology_of_Knowledge
Foucault argues that the contemporary study of the history of ideas, although it targets moments of transition between historical worldviews, ultimately depends on continuities that break down under close inspection. The history of ideas marks points of discontinuity between broadly defined modes of knowledge, but the assumption that those modes exist as wholes fails to do justice to the complexities of discourse. Foucault argues that "discourses" emerge and transform not according to a developing series of unarticulated, common worldviews, but according to a vast and complex set of discursive and institutional relationships, which are defined as much by breaks and ruptures as by unified themes.
  - duh

In contrast to structuralists, Foucault demonstrates that the semantic and syntactic structures do not suffice to determine the discursive meaning of an expression.
…
In short, the "statements" Foucault analysed are not propositions, phrases, or speech acts. Rather, "statements" constitute a network of rules establishing which expressions are discursively meaningful, and these rules are the preconditions for signifying propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have discursive meaning.
  - against analytic philosophy, and Wittgenstein
…
However, "statements" are also 'events', because, like other rules, they appear (or disappear) at some time.
  - ? tired, need to reread

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme
retrospective definition:
I would define the episteme retrospectively as the strategic apparatus which permits of separating out from among all the statements which are possible those that will be acceptable within, I won’t say a scientific theory, but a field of scientificity, and which it is possible to say are true or false. The episteme is the ‘apparatus’ which makes possible the separation, not of the true from the false, but of what may from what may not be characterised as scientific

Order of Things (p168) definition:
However, if in any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice. 

Foucault's use of episteme has been asserted as being similar to Thomas Kuhn's notion of a paradigm, as for example by Jean Piaget.[2] However, there are decisive differences. Whereas Kuhn's paradigm is an all-encompassing collection of beliefs and assumptions that result in the organization of scientific worldviews and practices, Foucault's episteme is not merely confined to science but to a wider range of discourse (all of science itself would fall under the episteme of the epoch). While Kuhn's paradigm shifts are a consequence of a series of conscious decisions made by scientists to pursue a neglected set of questions, Foucault's epistemes are something like the 'epistemological unconscious' of an era; the configuration of knowledge in a particular episteme is based on a set of fundamental assumptions that are so basic to that episteme so as to be invisible to people operating within it. Moreover, Kuhn's concept seems to correspond to what Foucault calls theme or theory of a science, but Foucault analysed how opposing theories and themes could co-exist within a science.[3] Kuhn doesn't search for the conditions of possibility of opposing discourses within a science, but simply for the (relatively) invariant dominant paradigm governing scientific research (supposing that one paradigm always is pervading, except under paradigmatic transition). In contrast, Foucault attempts to demonstrate the constitutive limits of discourse, and in particular, the rules enabling their productivity; however, Foucault maintained that though ideology may infiltrate and form science, it need not do so: it must be demonstrated how ideology actually forms the science in question; contradictions and lack of objectivity is not an indicator of ideology.[4] Kuhn's and Foucault's notions are both influenced by the French philosopher of science Gaston Bachelard's notion of an "epistemological rupture", as indeed was Althusser. More recently, Judith Butler used the concept of episteme in her book Excitable Speech, examining the use of speech-act theory for political purposes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_the_Clinic
In other words, the observations and analysis of an object (for instance a diseased organ) depended entirely upon the accepted practices as outlined in the contemporary organisation of knowledge. Investigation, diagnosis and treatment all followed that contemporary organisation, in which case the criteria that distinguishes a diseased organ from a healthy one is thoroughly historical.

Foucault would later formalise this notion in the episteme, where one epistemological era gives way to another, thus allowing one concept of what is scientific to move aside for another. In this case, as outlined in The Order of Things, the taxonomic era gave way to the organic historical era; thus, the clinic was not simply founded upon the observation of truth, and therefore more correct than any preceding medicinal practice, but rather an artefact of a theory of knowledge inserted within a specific discursive period. The authority of the clinician relies on a relationship to the then current organisation of knowledge, instead of a relationship to a non-discursive state of affairs ('reality'). Because of this, an early 18th-century doctor could observe an organ with exactly the same disease as a 19th-century doctor, with both doctors coming to vastly different conclusions about what caused the disease and how to treat it. Despite this difference, both accounts would be 'true', since they were both spoken in an episteme that considered such statements to be true.

  - "A postmodern version of pragmatism developed by the American philosopher Richard Rorty and drawing inspiration from authors such as John Dewey, Martin Heidegger, Wilfrid Sellars, Quine, and Jacques Derrida". It repudiates the notions of universal truth, epistemological foundationalism, representationalism, and epistemic objectivity. While traditional pragmatism focuses on experience, Rorty centers on language. It is a nominalist approach that denies that natural kinds and linguistic entities have substantive ontological implications. In Neopragmatism language is contingent on use, and meaning is produced by using words in familiar manners. The self is regarded as a "centerless web of beliefs and desires". Rorty denies that the subject-matter of the human sciences can be studied in the same ways as we study the natural sciences.

Kant referred to these objects as "The Thing in Itself" and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology
  - three main problems, subjectivity and objectivity, structure and agency, synchrony and diachron; or, knowledge, action, and time. 
    - s&o, A primary question for social theorists, is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved?
      - While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.
      - The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain.
    - Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism,[101] form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?").[102] A perennial question within this debate is that of "social reproduction": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals?

[this is a very good outline of continental philosophy of the mind.

Most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy).[88] Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy.[88] In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to the discussion of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.

Kant's work develops an in-depth study of transcendental consciousness, or the life of the mind as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.

In Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Philosophy of Mind (frequently translated as the Philosophy of Spirit or Geist),[89] the third part of his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind: the "subjective mind/spirit", the mind of an individual; the "objective mind/spirit", the mind of society and of the State; and the "Absolute mind/spirit", the position of religion, art, and philosophy. See also Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit
…
In modern times, the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on the contents of the human mind (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences.[90] Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people deal the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. See Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony
n Marxist philosophy, the term cultural hegemony describes the domination of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class, who manipulate the culture of that society—the beliefs, explanations, perceptions, values, and mores—so that their ruling-class worldview becomes the worldview that is imposed and accepted as the cultural norm; as the universally valid dominant ideology that justifies the social, political, and economic status quo as natural, inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial social constructs that benefit only the ruling class.

For the empiricists the word "real" refers to something, well, real; something pre-existing which has to be uncovered. For the Žižek/Lacan tradition, the word is spelled "Real" and refers to something which isn't real, is inaccessible, and which can never be defined as it is still, with Hegel, "im werden" (or, in becoming). This "Big Other", as Lacan termed it, is the hole occupied by the absent father or God, so that the Real is only present through its absence. This sort of stuff is dismissed as charlatanry by those who want something concrete to hold on to, whereas for the continentals the hole was always part of the whole. Our being is conditioned by absence, by the something that is missing and by the desire to fill that gap.

Habarmas Stanford article:
In his description of the salons we clearly see his interest in a communicative ideal that later would provide the core normative standard for his moral-political theory: the idea of inclusive critical discussion, free of social and economic pressures, in which interlocutors treat each other as equals in a cooperative attempt to reach an understanding on matters of common concern. As an ideal at the center of bourgeois culture, this kind of interchange was probably never fully realized; nonetheless, it “was not mere ideology” 

Capitalism wiki / Accumulation of Capital
Privatization of public services puts enormous profit into capitalists' hands. If it belonged to the public sector, that profit would not have existed. In that sense, the profit is created by dispossession of peoples or nations. Destructive industrial use of the environment is similar because the environment "naturally" belongs to everyone, or to noone: factually, it "belongs" to whoever lives there

Multinational pharmaceutical companies collect information about how herb or other natural medicine is used among natives in less-developed country, do some R&D to find the material that make those natural medicines effective, and patent the findings. By doing so, multinational pharmaceutical companies can now sell the medicine to the natives who are the original source of the knowledge that made production of medicine possible. That is, dispossession of folklore (knowledge, wisdom, practice) through intellectual property rights.

"The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization. The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights." by David Harvey

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory
is a school of thought that stresses the reflective assessment and critique of society and culture by applying knowledge from the social sciences and the humanities

the theorist Max Horkheimer described a theory as critical insofar as it seeks "to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them."

Critical theory maintains that ideology is the principal obstacle to human liberation.

sought to draw answers from other schools of thought, hence using the insights of antipositivist sociology, psychoanalysis, existential philosophy, and other disciplines

Following Marx, they were concerned with the conditions that allow for social change and the establishment of rational institutions

Their emphasis on the "critical" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism, materialism and determinism by returning to Kant's critical philosophy and its successors in German idealism, principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on dialectic and contradiction as inherent properties of human reality.

[Doesn’t much scholarly knowledge come from critical reading? No. It comes from real experience: science. So their method is looking toward realism and debating old knowledge. Fools. This leads nowhere. Just more terms and the revival of ancient ideas. Though, perhaps, helping create a canon, such as Marx.

Though, there is indeed a lot that comes out of it. The problem is of retranslating everything into common speech.

Like Zizek, takes cognitive problems (Freud), culture problems, comparative history, aesthetic theory, experience. Quite good topics actually. All over the place. Critique everything, modern life itself. Love it.]

Dialectical method, again:
In opposition to previous modes of thought, which viewed things in abstraction, each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties, Hegelian dialectic has the ability to consider ideas according to their movement and change in time, as well as according to their interrelations and interactions.

History, according to Hegel, proceeds and evolves in a dialectical manner: the present embodies the rational sublation, or "synthesis", of past contradictions. History may thus be seen as an intelligible process (which Hegel referred to as Weltgeist), which is the moving towards a specific condition—the rational realization of human freedom

This was fiercely criticized by Marx and the Young Hegelians.

Marx advanced his own theory of dialectical materialism, arguing that "it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.”* [yes!]

This method—to know the truth by uncovering the contradictions in presently predominant ideas and, by extension, in the social relations to which they are linked—exposes the underlying struggle between opposing forces. For Marx, it is only by becoming aware of the dialectic of such opposing forces, in a struggle for power, that individuals can liberate themselves and change the existing social order.* [yes!]

When Marx famously stated in his Theses on Feuerbach that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it", his real idea was that philosophy's only validity was in how it informed action.** [yes!]
|
Frankfurt School theorists would correct this by claiming that when action fails, then the theory guiding it must be reviewed. In short, socialist philosophical thought must be given the ability to criticize itself and "overcome" its own errors.*

Hence, our motto must be: reform of consciousness not through dogmas, but by analysing the mystical consciousness that is unintelligible to itself, whether it manifests itself in a religious or a political form. It will then become evident that the world has long dreamed of possessing something of which it has only to be conscious in order to possess it in reality. It will become evident that it is not a question of drawing a great mental dividing line between past and future, but of realising the thoughts of the past. Lastly, it will become evident that mankind is not beginning a new work, but is consciously carrying into effect its old work.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital
In Capital: Critique of Political Economy (1867), Karl Marx proposes that the motivating force of capitalism is in the exploitation of labour, whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of surplus value and then profit both of which concepts have a specific meaning for Marx. The employer is able to claim the right to profits because he or she owns the productive capital assets (means of production), which are legally protected by the capitalist state through property rights (the historical section shows how this right was acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the merchant and 'middle-man'). In producing capital (money) as well as commodities (goods and services), the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour. Capital proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the capitalist economic system, from its origins throughout its future, by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, the growth of wage labour, the transformation of the workplace, the concentration of capital, commercial competition, the banking system, the decline of the profit rate, land-rents, et cetera.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic
The dialectical method is discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject, who wish to establish the truth of the matter guided by reasoned arguments.

not causal, just related. A does not cause B. A is related to B.

Dual Process and Habituation:
Habituation can be described as decreased response to a repeated stimulus. According to Groves and Thompson, the process of habituation also mimics a dual process. The dual process theory of habituation relies on two processes; habituation and sensitization. Habituation weakens the intensity of a repeated stimulus over time subconsciously. As a result, a person will give the stimulus less conscious attention over time. Conversely, sensitization subconsciously strengthens a stimulus over time, giving the stimulus more conscious attention. Though these two systems are not both conscious, they interact to help people understand their surroundings by strengthening some stimuli and diminishing others.

Fuzzy Trace theory:
According to Charles Brainerd and Valerie Reyna’s Fuzzy-trace theory of memory and reasoning, people have two memory representations: verbatim and gist. Verbatim is memory for surface information (e.g.-the words in this sentence) whereas gist is memory for semantic information (e.g.-the meaning of this sentence). This dual process theory posits that we encode, store, retrieve, and forget the information in these two traces of memory separately and completely independent of each other. Furthermore, the two memory traces decay at different rates: verbatim decays quickly, while gist lasts longer. In terms of reasoning, Fuzzy-Trace Theory posits that as we mature we increasingly rely more on gist information over verbatim information. Evidence for this lies in framing experiments where framing effects become stronger when verbatim information(percentages) are replaced with gist descriptions.

Alienation and freedom:
Hunter-gatherer societies were structured so that the economic forces and the political forces were one and the same. The elements of force and relation operated together, harmoniously. In the feudal society, the political forces of the kings and nobility had their relations with the economic forces of the villages through serfdom. The serfs, although not free, were tied to both forces and, thus, not completely alienated. Capitalism, Marx argued, completely separates the economic and political forces, leaving them to have relations through a limiting government. He takes the state to be a sign of this separation - it exists to manage the massive conflicts of interest which arise between classes in all those societies based on property relations.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom
Axioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in theoretical physics. In particular, the monumental work of Isaac Newton is essentially based on Euclid's axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of spacetime and the physics taking place in it at any moment.

In 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by those of Albert Einstein's special relativity, and later on by those of general relativity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science
Materials Science:
Materials science, also commonly known as materials science and engineering, is an interdisciplinary field which deals with the discovery and design of new materials
…
It incorporates elements of physics and chemistry and is at the forefront of nanoscience and nanotechnology research

Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.
…
history:
Phrases such as Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Steel Age are great examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of ceramics and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science.

Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as plastics, semiconductors, and biomaterials.

Before the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many materials science departments were named metallurgy departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals.
…
fundamentals of materials science:
The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their properties. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, he/she can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics, govern a material’s microstructure, and thus its properties.

As mentioned above, structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science.

Nanomaterials are subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit.

Materials exhibit myriad properties. The important properties of materials are as follows:
…
Mechanical properties:
Chemical Properties
Electrical Properties
Thermal Properties
Optical Properties
Magnetic Properties
The properties of a materials determine its usability and hence its engineering application.
…
Synthesis and processing:
Synthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micro/nanostructure. From an engineering standpoint, a material cannot be used in industry if no economical manufacturing method for it has been developed. Thus, the processing of materials is very important to the field of materials science.
…
Thermodynamics:
Thermodynamics is concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. It defines macroscopic variables, such as internal energy, entropy, and pressure, that partly describe a body of matter or radiation

The study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium.
…
Kinetics:
Kinetics is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces.
…
Computational materials science and materials theory:
With the increase in computing power, simulating the behavior of materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to discover properties of materials previously unknown, as well as to design new materials. Up until now, new materials were found by a time consuming trial and error process. But, now it is hoped that computational techniques could drastically reduce that time, and allow us to tailor materials properties. This involves simulating materials at all length scales, using methods such as density functional theory, molecular dynamics, etc.
  - very neat, creating with theory
…
Composite materials:
Another application of materials science in industry is the making of composite materials. Composite materials are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. 

Polymers:
Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what we commonly call plastics.

Metal alloys
…
Materials science evolved—starting from the 1960s—because it was recognized that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged at the intersection of various fields such as metallurgy, solid state physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering.*


Material for an engineer is of utmost importance. The usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems, and hence, engineers are always involved in materials. Thus, materials science is becoming increasingly important in an engineer's education.
…
The term picotechnology is a neologism intended to parallel the term nanotechnology. It is a hypothetical future level of technological manipulation of matter, on the scale of trillionths of a meter or picoscale(10−12). This is three orders of magnitude smaller than a nanometer (and thus most nanotechnology) and two orders of magnitude smaller than most chemistry transformations and measurements. Picotechnology would involve the manipulation of matter at the atomic level. A further hypothetical development, femtotechnology, would involve working with matter at the sub-atomic level.
…
Redox reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed; in general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between species.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_arts
The distinction between the decorative and the fine arts has essentially arisen from the post-Renaissance art of the West, where the distinction is for the most part meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most highly regarded works – or even all works – include those in decorative media. For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, as does the art of many traditional cultures. The distinction between decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating Chinese art, and neither is it for understanding Early Medieval art in Europe. In that period in Europe, fine arts such as manuscript illuminationand monumental sculpture existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in goldsmith work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as ivory carving.

They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for mosaic, which for this period must be viewed as a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be seen as decorative.
  - the progression of aesthetic

Modern understanding of the art of many cultures tends to be distorted by the modern privileging of fine art media over others, as well as the very different survival rates of works in different media.

And

The promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as Vasari promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the High Renaissance, that placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as Michelangelo, Raphael or Leonardo da Vinci.

Works in metal, above all in precious metals, are liable to be "recycled" as soon as they fall from fashion, and were often used by owners as repositories of wealth, to be melted down when extra money was needed. Illuminated manuscripts have a much higher survival rate, especially in the hands of the church, as there was little value in the materials and they were easy to store.
 - decorative arts are more likely to disappear

Middle Ages had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques had been highly valued.
 - lesser art

In China both approaches had co-existed for many centuries.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_place
The term sense of place has been used in many different ways. To some, it is a characteristic that some geographic places have[clarification needed] and some do not, while to others it is a feeling or perception held by people (not by the place itself). It is often used in relation to those characteristics that make a place special or unique, as well as to those that foster a sense of authentic human attachment and belonging.

Of particular note is the importance of childhood experiences.[3] Environmental psychologists have quantified links between exposure to natural environments in childhood and environmental preferences later in life.[4] Learning about surrounding environments during childhood is strongly influenced by the direct experience of playing, as well as through the role of family, culture, and community.[5] The special bond which develops between children and their childhood environments has been called a ‘primal landscape’ by human geographers.[6] This childhood landscape forms part of people’s identity and constitutes a key point of comparison for considering subsequent places later in life.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony
In Marxist philosophy, the term cultural hegemony describes the domination of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class, who manipulate the culture of that society — the beliefs, explanations, perceptions, values, and mores — so that their ruling-class worldview becomes the worldview that is imposed and accepted as the cultural norm; as the universally valid dominant ideology that justifies the social, political, and economic status quo as natural, inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial social constructs that benefit only the ruling class.

Since these various categories of traditional intellectuals [administrators, scholars and scientists, theorists, non-ecclesiastical philosophers, etc.] experience through an esprit de corps their uninterrupted historical continuity, and their special qualifications, they thus put themselves forward as autonomous and independent of the dominant social group. This self-assessment is not without consequences in the ideological and political fields, consequences of wide-ranging import. The whole of idealist philosophy can easily be connected with this position, assumed by the social complex of intellectuals, and can be defined as the expression of that social utopia by which the intellectuals think of themselves as “independent” [and] autonomous, [and] endowed with a character of their own, etc.
...
The traditional and vulgarized type of the intellectual is given by the Man of Letters, the philosopher, and the artist. Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the “true” intellectuals. In the modern world, technical education, closely bound to industrial labor, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. . . .

The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as “permanent persuader”, not just simple orator.

...
The Long March through the Institutions...the working class would produce their own organic intellectuals and culture (dominant ideology) to replace those imposed by the bourgeoisi

Ideology:
ideology is a coherent system of ideas, relying upon a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Ideas become ideologies (that is, become coherent, repeated patterns) through the subjective ongoing choices that people make, serving as the seed around which further thought grows. 

Though the word "ideology" is most often found in political discourse, there are many different kinds of ideology: political, social, epistemological, ethical, etc.

Marx posits that the dominant society's ideology is integral to it's superstructure...Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness, such as in the case of commodity fetishism—the belief that value is inherent to a commodity, rather than external, added to it via labor.

Antonio Gramsci uses cultural hegemony to explain why the working-class have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests

all ideology (including Marxism) resulted from social life

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind
The unconscious mind (or the unconscious) consists of the processes in the mind that occur automatically and are not available to introspection, and include thought processes, memory, affect, and motivation.[1] Even though these processes exist well under the surface of conscious awareness they are theorized to exert an impact on behavior.

It has been argued that consciousness is influenced by other parts of the mind. These include unconsciousness as a personal habit, being unaware, and intuition.

individuals register information about the frequency of events automatically (i.e., outside of conscious awareness and without engaging conscious information processing resources). 

Interestingly, the ability to unconsciously and relatively accurately tally the frequency of events appears to have little or no relation to the individual's age,[46] education, intelligence, or personality, thus it may represent one of the fundamental building blocks of human orientation in the environment and possibly the acquisition of procedural knowledge and experience, in general.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology_of_knowledge

Durkheim:
Analysis of totems which represent and forces a view:
Through représentations collectives the group exerts pressure on the individual to conform to society's norms of morality and thought. As such, collective representations help to order and make sense of the world, but they also express, symbolize and interpret social relationships.

Foccault:
Perhaps Foucault's best-known claim[according to whom?] was that "Man did not exist" before the 18th century. Foucault regarded notions of humanity and of humanism as inventions of modernity. Accordingly, a cognitive bias had been introduced unwittingly into science, by over-trusting the individual doctor or scientist's ability to see and state things objectively. Foucault roots this argument in the rediscovery of Kant, though his thought is significantly influenced by Nietzsche - that philosopher declaring the "death of God" in the 19th century, and the anti-humanists proposing the "death of Man" in the 20th.

In Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison, Foucault concentrates on the correlation between knowledge and power. According to him, knowledge is a form of power and can conversely be used against individuals as a form of power.[13] As a result, knowledge is socially constructed in order to maintain the power of the ruling class.[14] He argues that knowledge forms discourses and discourses form the dominant ideological ways of thinking which govern our lives.[15] For him, social control is maintained in ‘the disciplinary society’, through codes of control over sexuality and the ideas/knowledge perpetuated through social institutions.[16] In other words, discourses and ideologies subject us to authority and turn people into ‘subjected beings’, who are in turn afraid of being punished if they sway from social norms.[17] Foucault believes that institutions overtly regulate and control our lives. Institutions such as schools reinforce the dominant ideological forms of thinking onto the populace and force us into becoming obedient and docile beings.[18] Hence, the dominant ideology that serves the interests of the ruling class, all the while appearing as `neutral`, needs to be questioned and must not go unchallenged

From M.I.A’s wiki:
Maya told Arthur magazine "[Students there were] exploring apathy, dressing up in some pigeon outfit, or running around conceptualising... It missed the whole point of art representing society. Social reality didn’t really exist there; it just stopped at theory."[13] She cited "radical cinema" including Harmony Korine, Dogme 95 and Spike Jonze as some of her cinematic inspirations during film school.[14] As a student, she was approached by director John Singleton to work on a film in Los Angeles after he had read a script she had written, though she decided not to take up the offer.

From Dylan's wiki:
"The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough ... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings."

In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City, to perform there and visit his musical idol, Woody Guthrie,[22] who was seriously ill with Huntington's disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.[23] Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact, he wrote: "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociological_theory
In sociology, sociological theories are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related.

Kenneth Allan[4] proposed the distinction between sociological theory and social theory. In Allan's usage, sociological theory consists of abstract and testable propositions about society.[4] It often heavily relies on the scientific method, which aims for objectivity, and attempts to avoid passing value judgments. In contrast, social theory, according to Allan, focuses on commentary and critique of modern society rather than explanation.[4] Social theory is often closer to Continental philosophy; thus, it is less concerned with objectivity and derivation of testable propositions, and more likely to pass normative judgments.[5] Sociological theory is generally created only by sociologists, while social theory can frequently come from other disciplines.

Prominent sociological theorists include Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Randall Collins, James Samuel Coleman, Peter Blau, Marshal McLuhan, Immanuel Wallerstein, George Homans, Harrison White, Theda Skocpol, Gerhard Lenski, Pierre van den Berghe and Jonathan H. Turner.[5] Prominent social theorists include: Jürgen Habermas, Anthony Giddens, Michel Foucault, Dorothy Smith, Alfred Schütz, Jeffrey Alexander, and Jacques Derrida.[5] There are also prominent scholars who could be seen as being in-between social and sociological theories, such as Harold Garfinkel, Herbert Blumer, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Pierre Bourdieu and Erving Goffman.

Sociological theory attempts to answer the following three questions: (1) What is action? (2) What is social order? and (3) What determines social change?

The consensus on the central theoretical problems is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following "big three" dichotomies:[7] subjectivity and objectivity, structure and agency, and synchrony and diachrony.

The first deals with knowledge, the second with agency, and the last with time.*****

Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems.

These problems are not altogether empirical problems, rather they are epistemological: they arise from the conceptual imagery and analytical analogies that sociologists use to describe the complexity of social processes.

The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinct:

How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialized and led to feel "like a fish in water" within that social world whose structures she has internalized? How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself-conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject

Structure and Agency:
Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism,[8] form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_reproduction
Social reproduction according to sociologist Christopher B. Doob, “refers to the emphasis on the structures and activities that transmit social inequality from one generation to the next”.[1] There are four types of capital that contributes to social reproduction in society. They are financial capital, cultural capital, human capital, and social capital.

Four Types of Capital[edit]
Financial capital refers to the income and wealth of a person. Financial capital will influence the cultural capital one receives. Cultural capital is the shared outlook, beliefs, knowledge, and skills that are passed between generations. Cultural capital influences Human capital, which refers to the education and job training a person receives. Human capital creates the ability for one to attain social capital, which is essentially the social network to which one belongs. Social capital can largely influence one’s ability to find an internship or job.

All four forms of capital play a role in social reproduction because capital is passed from generation to generation and keeps people in the same social class as their parents before them. This keeps reproducing inequality through the system of social stratification.

[this outlook seems outdated from the Information age]

in order to show the interdependence of action and structure...we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction."

Classical traditions:
The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic.[11] In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory[12] he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction

Functionalism: A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and anthropology, functionalism addresses the social structure as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by Herbert Spencer) is to regard norms and institutions as 'organs' that work toward the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.[17] The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as Marcel Mauss, Bronisław Malinowski and Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.[18] Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of social evolutionism. As Giddens states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."


Symbolic Interactionism:
Symbolic interaction; often associated with Interactionism, Phenomenological sociology, Dramaturgy, Interpretivism, is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through analysis.[23] The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings.[24] Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation.[25] Some important sociologists associated with this approach include Max Weber, George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, George Homans and Peter Blau. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of Ethnomethodology emerges from the work of Harold Garfinkel.

Utilitarianism:
Utilitarianism is often referred to as exchange theory or rational choice theory in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest.

List of contemporary theories:
Anomie theory, seeks to understand normlessness, where society provides little moral guidance to individuals.

Engaged theory is an approach that seeks to understand the complexity of social life through synthesizing empirical research with more abstract layers of analysis, including analysis of modes of practice, and analysis of basic categories of existence such a time, space, embodiment, and knowledge

Grounded theory is a systematic methodology in the social sciences involving the generation of theory from data

Interpretive sociology is a theoretical perspective based on the work of Max Weber, proposes that social, economic and historical research can never be fully empirical or descriptive as one must always approach it with a conceptual apparatus.

Middle Range theory is an approach to sociological theorizing aimed at integrating theory and empirical research. It is currently the de facto dominant approach to sociological theory construction, especially in the United States. Middle range theory starts with an empirical phenomenon (as opposed to a broad abstract entity like the social system) and abstracts from it to create general statements that can be verified by data.

Mathematical theory, also known as formal theory, is the use of mathematics to construct social theories. Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms. The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.

Positivism is a philosophy developed by Auguste Comte in the middle of the 19th century that stated that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only come from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method.[42] Society operates according to laws like the physical world. Introspective and intuitional attempts to gain knowledge are rejected. The positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought, from the Ancient Egyptians to the present day.

Phenomenological sociology is an approach within the field of sociology that aims to reveal what role human awareness plays in the production of social action, social situations and social worlds. In essence, phenomenology is the belief that society is a human construction. The social phenomenology of Alfred Schütz influenced the development of the social constructionism and ethnomethodology. It was originally developed by Edmund Husserl.

Postmodernism is a theoretical perspective approach that criticises modernism and believes anti-theory and anti-method and has a great mistrust of grand theories and ideologies. Due to human subjectivity, theorists believe that discovering the objective truth is impossible or unachievable.[43] This is due to a perspective that sees society as ever-changing along with the assumption that truth is constantly subject to change. A post-modern theorist's purpose is to achieve understanding through observation, rather than data collection. This approach uses both micro and macro level analysis.[44] A question that is asked by this approach would be, "How do we understand societies or interpersonal relations, while rejecting the theories and methods of the social sciences, and our assumptions about human nature? or How does power permeate social relations or society, and change with the circumstances? "[45] An example of a prominent postmodernist is the French philosopher Michael Foucault.

Pure sociology is a theoretical paradigm developed by Donald Black that explains variation in social life with social geometry, that is, locations in social space. A recent extension of this idea is that fluctuations in social space - called social time - are the cause of social conflict. *****

Rational choice theory models social behavior as the interaction of utility maximizing individuals. "Rational" implies cost-effectiveness is balanced against cost to accomplish a utility maximizing interaction. Costs are extrinsic, meaning intrinsic values such as feelings of guilt will not be accounted for in the cost to commit a crime.

Socialization theory is an approach to understanding the means by which human infants begin to acquire the skills necessary to perform as a functional member of their society[48] Sociologists use the term socialization to refer to the lifelong social experience by which people develop their human potential and learn culture. Unlike other living species, humans need socialization within their cultures for survival.

Thomas theorem refers to situations that are defined as real are real in their consequences.[50] Suggests that the reality people construct in their interaction has real consequences for the future. For example, a teacher who believes a certain student to be intellectually gifted may well encourage exceptional academic performance.

Control theory: The theory was developed by Travis Hirschi and it states that a weak bond between an individual and society itself allows the individual to defy societal norms and adopt behaviors that are deviant in nature.[55] ***

Social learning theory: States that people adopt new behaviors through observational learning in their environments. ***

criminology:
White-collar crime: defined by Edwin Sutherland as crime committed by persons of high social position in the course of their occupation (Sutherland and Cressey, 1978:44).[61] The white-collar crime involves people making use of their occupational position to enrich themselves and others illegally, which often causes public harm.[61] In white-collar crime, public harm wreaked by false advertising, marketing of unsafe products, embezzlement, and bribery of public officials is more extensive than most people think, most of which go unnoticed and unpunished. **

Corporate crime: refers to the illegal actions of a corporation or people acting on its behalf. Corporate crime ranges from knowingly selling faulty or dangerous products to purposely polluting the environment. Like white-collar crime, most cases of corporate crime go unpunished, and many are not never even known to the public.

“I had been a fan of Pynchon for a number of years, but I’m always excited to read something that takes place in California in the seventies,” the Nevada City native says over the phone from Los Angeles. “It’s definitely my favorite decade of music.” This infatuation has led to a massive collection of vinyl (“I don’t have an iPod, I don’t have a CD player”) that takes up almost all of her Grass Valley home, and a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of music from the era. “I think of it as the singer-songwriter decade,” she says. “It’s the heyday of analogue studio recordings, before things got digital. You can still feel the hand of the creator because it doesn’t live on the computer.”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake
In 1966 Drake enrolled at a tutorial college in Five Ways, Birmingham, from where he won a scholarship to study English literature at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge.[20] He delayed attendance to spend six months at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, beginning in February 1967. While in Aix, he began to practice guitar in earnest, and to earn money would often busk with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke cannabis, and that spring he travelled with friends to Morocco, because, according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, "that was where you got the best pot".[21] Drake most likely began using LSD while in Aix,[22] and lyrics written during this period—in particular for the song "Clothes of Sand"—are suggestive of an interest in hallucinogens.
…
In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: "He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!"
…
Drake ended his studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London to concentrate on a career in music.[40] His father remembered "writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want."[12] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors.[41] Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.
…
Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.
…
In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered that "Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it. Just left the stage."[51] His frustration turned to depression,[52] and in 1971 Drake was persuaded by his family to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed a course of antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends.[53] He knew enough about drugs to worry about their side effects, and was concerned about how they would react with his regular marijuana use.
…
Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby has described as "unbelievable amounts" of marijuana[55] and exhibiting "the first signs of psychosis", refused. By the winter of 1970, he had isolated himself in London.[40] Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: "This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong."
…
An advertisement for the album in Melody Maker in February opened with "Pink Moon—Nick Drake's latest album: the first we heard of it was when it was finished."
…
In Zigzag magazine, Connor McKnight wrote, "Nick Drake is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that."
…
The "shy and introverted folk singer" spoke of his dislike of live appearances and very little else.[66] "There wasn't any connection whatsoever", Gilbert has said. "I don't think he made eye contact with me once."[66] Disheartened and convinced he would be unable to write again, Drake decided to retire from music. He toyed with the idea of a different career, even considering the army.
...
In the months following Pink Moon's release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant from those close to him.[68] He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. "I don't like it at home," he told his mother, "but I can't bear it anywhere else."[12] His return was often difficult for his family; as his sister Gabrielle explained, "good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really."
…
He lived a frugal existence, his only source of income being a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records. At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes.[70] He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back."
…
Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 wrote the title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) described him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met.[73] He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed.[74] During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails.[67] Early in 1972, Drake suffered a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.
…
As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.
…
At some time during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at home in Far Leys, Tanworth-in-Arden, from an overdose of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He had gone to bed early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was used to hearing him do this many times before but, during this instance, he did not make a sound. They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills "to help him sleep".[81] Drake was accustomed to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning. Recalling the events of the night, his mother later said: "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long, long legs."[82] There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.
…
The funeral was attended by around 50 mourners, including friends from Marlborough, Aix, Cambridge, London, Witchseason, and Tanworth.[86] Referring to Drake's tendency to compartmentalise relationships, Brian Wells observed that many met each other for the first time that morning.[87] Molly recalled "a lot of his young friends came up here. We'd never met many of them."
…
Kirby described Drake's lyrics as a "series of extremely vivid, complete observations, almost like a series of epigrammatic proverbs", though he doubts that Drake saw himself as "any sort of poet". Instead he believes that Drake's lyrics were crafted to "complement and compound a mood that the melody dictates in the first place."

Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over a mutual appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together.[2] Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Bob Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group.[3] The two were interested in the achievements of Dylan and Brian Wilson and realized the importance of practicing music from a young age.
…
Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Pecknold
Robin Pecknold was born in Seattle in 1986. He is said to have written his first song at the age of 14. The song is called "Sarah Jane" and tells the story of a runaway who turns to prostitution.
…
He has an older brother, Sean, and an older sister, Aja. His brother is a director and the founder of grandchildren.tv. Sean has directed five music videos for Fleet Foxes. His grandfather, Bob Valaas, is Norwegian. Pecknold comes from a musical background; his father played in the Seattle-based soul band The Fathoms in the 1960s and his elder sister, Aja, was a rock critic for magazine Seattle Weekly and is the band's manager.[8]

He has said he experiences social anxiety and in 2008 said: "I don't really hang out with anyone. I'll hang out with my band, because I love them, but I don't have any friends aside from that."[9]

In 2009, he stated that he discovered virtually all of the music he listened to by using online file-sharing program Napster. He also spoke of his support for online file-sharing and the positive effect he believes it to have on music, both as an art form and as an industry.[10][11] Pecknold is a vegan.[2]

In November 2013 Fleet Foxes-member Morgan Henderson mentioned that Pecknold had relocated to New York City where he is enrolled as a student at Columbia University.[12][13]

He left boarding school in 1985 and started to trek the length of Tibet on foot when he was 19. He took a small camera on his trip and photographed his journey, which lasted about a year.[2] After his return Nelson started to work as a professional photojournalist and was commissioned to cover a variety of themes, ranging from the Russian involvement in Afghanistan and the ongoing strife between India and Pakistan in Kashmir to the beginning of the war in former Yugoslavia.[3]

In 1992 Nelson was commissioned by Shell Oil to produce the book "Literary Portraits of China" and travelled the country for 36 months together with his wife Ashkaine Hora Adema . Hora Adema wrote the commissioned book and became the business partner of Nelson. Upon its completion the images were exhibited in the children's Palace on Tiananmen Square, Beijing, followed by a worldwide tour.
…

In 2009 Nelson started to work on his biggest project to-date, Before they Pass Away. He travelled for 3 years and photographed more than 35 indigenous tribes around the world in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and the South Pacific, using a 50-year-old 4x5in camera.

  - Chomsky vs Foucault
  - Foucault uses vague terms he created to describe his concepts of things, Chomsky uses common language to describe things
  - Chomsky: A fundamental element of human nature is the need for creative work, creative inquiry, free creation, without the arbitrary limiting effects of coercive institutions, therefore it should follow that a decent society should maximize the possibilities for this fundamental human characteristic to be realized. That means trying to overcome the elements of oppression, repression, destruction, coercion, that exists in any society, and a historical residue. Now a federated, decentralized system of free associations, incorporating economic as well as social institutions, will be a an anarcho-syndacalism.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault
Critiques [of him]
Crypto-normativity:
Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive - even as an ideal.

Social Construction and Human Nature:
Foucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social constructionism, which some see as an affront to the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice.[172] Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating "He struck me as completely amoral, I’d never met anyone who was so totally amoral" ... "I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something."

The reputation and history of Damascus steel has given rise to many legends, such as the ability to cut through a rifle barrel or to cut a hair falling across the blade,.[4] A research team in Germany published a report in 2006 revealing nanowires and carbon nanotubes in a blade forged from Damascus steel.[5] This finding was covered by National Geographic[6] and the New York Times.[7] Although certain types of modern steel outperform these swords, chemical reactions in the production process made the blades extraordinary for their time, as damascus steel was superplastic and very hard at the same time. During the smelting process to obtain Wootz steel ingots, woody biomass and leaves are known to have been used as carburizing additives along with certain specific types of iron rich in microalloying elements. These ingots would then be further forged and worked into Damascus steel blades, and research now shows that carbon nanotubes can be derived from plant fibers,[8] suggesting how the nanotubes were formed in the steel. Some experts expect to discover such nanotubes in more relics as they are analyzed more closely.

  - what’s after capitalism? Modest improvements of capitalism, such as Obama trying universal healthcare.
  - if one leaves it to direct democracy, people will just create a global secluded bubble. Even right now, every city has a slum. The class struggle will still exist but in a larger way. Virgin airlines going to space, etc.

  - cinema verite
  - style of documentary filmmaking, invented by Jean Rouch, inspired by Dziga Vertov's theory about Kino-Pravda and influenced by Robert Flaherty’s films. It combines improvisation with the use of the camera to unveil truth or highlight subjects hidden behind crude reality.
  - As Edgar Morin wrote: "There are two ways to conceive of the cinema of the Real: the first is to pretend that you can present reality to be seen; the second is to pose the problem of reality. In the same way, there were two ways to conceive cinéma vérité. The first was to pretend that you brought truth. The second was to pose the problem of truth."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Civil_War
The effectiveness of the U.S. bombing on the Khmer Rouge and the death toll of Cambodian civilians is disputed. With limited data, the range of Cambodian deaths caused by U.S. bombing may be between 40,000 and 600,000.[39][40][41][42][43] Another impact of the U.S. bombing and the Cambodian civil war was to destroy the homes and livelihood of many people. This was a heavy contributor to the refugee crisis in Cambodia with two million people—more than 25 percent of the population—displaced from rural areas into the cities, especially Phnom Penh which grew from about 600,000 in 1970 to an estimated population of nearly 2 million by 1975. The Cambodian government estimated that more than 20 percent of the property in the country had been destroyed during the war.[44]

It has been argued that the U.S. intervention in Cambodia contributed to the eventual seizure of power by the Khmer Rouge, that grew from 4,000 in number in 1970 to 70,000 in 1975.[45] This view has been disputed,[46][47][48] with documents uncovered from the Soviet archives revealing that the North Vietnamese offensive in Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea.[5] Yet others maintain that U.S intervention brought about the rise of the Khmer Rouge. [49][50] It has also been argued that U.S. bombing was decisive in delaying a Khmer Rouge victory.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(political_science)
Social engineering - a human being is a biological creature from birth but is from then on shaped as a person through social influences (upbringing/socialisation) and is in that sense a social construction.

A social engineer is one who tries to influence popular attitudes, social behaviors, and resource management on a large scale. 

In the political arena, the counterpart of social engineering is political engineering.

Unlike many moralists of the time, Descartes was not devoid of passions but rather defended them; he wept upon her death in 1640.

Russell Shorto postulated that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes' work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.

Despite frequent moves[24] he wrote all his major work during his 20-plus years in the Netherlands, where he managed to revolutionize mathematics and philosophy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunun_people
After an initial period of fierce resistance, they were forced to move down from the mountains and concentrated into a number of lowland villages that were spread across the Island. As a result, the family unit became less important and life centred on individual village units.

After the arrival of the Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang in October 1945, difficult days began for the aboriginal population. The "one language, one culture" policy of the Nationalist government prohibited to use of any language other than Mandarin Chinese, for official use as well as in daily life, and indigenous cultures were systematically discriminated against and encouraged to assimilate into mainstream culture. Bunun culture was eroded by the joint pressure of their new faith as well as the government's sinification policies. The situation improved only recently, when after two decades of democratic reforms.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amis_people
Matrilineal

Traditional Amis villages were relatively large for indigenous groups, typically between 500 and 1,000. In today's Taiwan, the Amis also comprise the majority of "urban aboriginals" and have developed many "urban tribes" all around the island. In recent decades, Amis have also married exogamously to Han as well as other indigenous.

Family affairs including finance of the family are decided by the female householder, in the Ami tradition

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_peoples
The Austronesian inhabitants of Polynesia were unaffected by this cultural trade, and retained their indigenous culture in the Pacific region.

Meanwhile, the British, Germans, French, Americans, and Japanese began establishing spheres of influence within the Pacific Islands during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Japanese later invaded most of Southeast Asia and some parts of the Pacific during World War II. The latter half of the 20th century initiated independence of modern-day Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and many of the Pacific Island nations.

The authors of the study suggest that this may be evidence of two different human migration routes during the peopling of Eastern Asia; one coastal and the other inland, with little genetic flow between them.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundaland
Genetic similarities were found between populations throughout Asia and an increase in genetic diversity from northern to southern latitudes. Although the Chinese population is very large, it has less variation than the smaller number of individuals living in Southeast Asia, because the Chinese expansion occurred very recently, within only the last 2,000 to 3,000 years, following the perfection of rice agriculture.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism
As with those who engage in other activities such as singing or running, the term may apply broadly to anyone who engages in it even briefly, or be more narrowly limited to those for whom it is a vocation, habit, or characteristic practice. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment
Empowerment refers to increasing the economic, political, social, educational, gender, or spiritual strength of an entity or entities.

Equal opportunity laws which actively oppose such marginalization, allow increased empowerment to occur. They are also a symptom of minorities' and women's empowerment through lobbying.

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare. They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting. The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems.

Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for marginalized people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, self-sufficiency, with a focus on eliminating the future need for charity or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

Strategy:
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own nonprofit organization, using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. Red Cross, for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility - and credit - for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression#Internalized_oppression

Social oppression:
Social oppression is the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group, category, or team of people or individual.

Institutional Oppression:
"Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systematically reflect and produce inequities based on one’s membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions.

systematic oppression:
Police and law themselves are often examples of systematic oppression. The term oppression in such instances to refer to the subordination of a given group or social category by unjust use of force, authority, or societal norms in order to achieve indoctrination.

Through institutionalization, formally or informally, it achieves the dimension of systematic oppression.

Oppression is customarily experienced as a consequence of, and expressed in, the form of a prevailing, if unconscious, assumption that the given target is in some way inferior.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_as_Experience* COME BACK
Dewey's theory, here, is an attempt to shift the understandings of what is important and characteristic about the art process from its physical manifestations in the ‘expressive object’ to the process in its entirety, a process whose fundamental element is no longer the material ‘work of art’ but rather the development of an ‘experience’. An experience is something that personally affects your life. That is why these theories are so important to our social and educational life.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism
Epicurus believed that what he called "pleasure" is the greatest good, but the way to attain such pleasure is to live modestly and to gain knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of one's desires. This led one to attain a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear, as well as absence of bodily pain (aponia). The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism
Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all phenomena, including mental phenomena and consciousness, are the result of material interactions.
  - contrasts with idealism, monism, dualism, and pluralism

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism
In philosophy, idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society.[1] As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.[2] Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_psychology
Functional psychology or functionalism refers to a psychological philosophy that considers mental life and behaviour in terms of active adaptation to the person's environment.[1] As such, it provides the general basis for developing psychological theories not readily testable by controlled experiments and for applied psychology.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#Deficits
The theory of mind (ToM) impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective taking. This is also sometimes referred to as mind-blindness. This means that individuals with a ToM impairment would have a hard time seeing things from any other perspective than their own.[37] Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity.[38] ToM deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders, people with schizophrenia, people with attention deficit disorder,[2] persons under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science*****
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff
    - thesis that lives of individuals are significantly influenced by the central metaphors they use to explain complex phenomena. [sounds similar to Hofsdatser’s Surfaces and Essences]
    - he is most famous for his reappraisal of the role that metaphors play in socio-political lives of humans
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition:
      - argue that all aspects of cognition are shaped by aspects of the body*
      - This is a radical move towards a total re-localization of mental processes out of the neural domain



  - subtopics of Cognitive Science:
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor***
      - refers to the understanding of one idea, or conceptual domain, in terms of another. An example of this is the understanding of quantity in terms of directionality (e.g. "the prices are rising").
      - A conceptual domain can be any coherent organization of human experience. The regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, which often appear to be perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain.
      - Conceptual metaphors are seen in language in our everyday lives. Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also shape the way we think and act.
      - A primary tenet of this theory is that metaphors are matter of thought and not merely of language: hence, the term conceptual metaphor*
      - conceptual metaphors underlie a system of related metaphorical expressions that appear on the linguistic surface

       - Urban theorist and ethicist Jane Jacobs made this distinction in less gender-driven if not wholly desexualizing terms by differentiating between a 'Guardian Ethic' and a 'Trader Ethic'.[6] She states that guarding and trading are two concrete activities that human beings must learn to apply metaphorically to all choices in later life. In a society where guarding children is the primary female duty and trading in a market economy is the primary male duty
        - Both of these theories suggest that there may be a great deal of social conditioning and pressure to form specific cognitive bias. Anthropologists observe that all societies tend to have roles assigned by age and gender, which supports this view.

   - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_schema***
     - In contemporary cognitive linguistics, an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates conceptual metaphor mappings. 
     - The principle of unidirectionality states that the metaphorical process typically goes from the more concrete to the more abstract, and not the other way around.
     - mathematics itself, the most widely accepted means of abstraction in the human community, is largely metaphorically constructed

  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)***
    - set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies organize, perceive, and communicate about reality
    - Framing involves the social construction of a social phenomenon - by mass media sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. 
    - In social theory, framing is a schema of interpretation, a collection of anecdotes and stereotypes, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events.[3] In other words, people build a series of mental "filters" through biological and cultural influences.[citation needed] They then use these filters to make sense of the world. The choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.
    - Framing is also a key component of sociology, the study of social interaction among humans. Framing is an integral part of conveying and processing data on a daily basis. Successful framing techniques can be used to reduce the ambiguity of intangible topics by contextualizing the information in such a way that recipients can connect to what they already know.
    - framing in mass communication: News media frame all news items by emphasizing specific values, facts, and other considerations, and endowing them with greater apparent applicability for making related judgments. News media promotes particular definitions, interpretations, evaluations and recommendations.
    
    - subtopics of framing:
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory

  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias
    -  a pattern of deviation in judgment, whereby inferences about other people and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion.
    - Individuals create their own "subjective social reality" from their perception of the input.[2] An individual's construction of social reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behaviour in the social world.[3] Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.
   - Some cognitive biases are presumably adaptive. Cognitive biases may lead to more effective actions in a given context.[7] Furthermore, cognitive biases enable faster decisions when timeliness is more valuable than accuracy, as illustrated in heuristics.[8] Other cognitive biases are a "by-product" of human processing limitations,[9] resulting from a lack of appropriate mental mechanisms (bounded rationality), or simply from a limited capacity for information processing.
   - A continually evolving list of cognitive biases has been identified over the last six decades of research on human judgment and decision-making in cognitive science, social psychology, and behavioral economics. Cognitive biases are important to study because "systematic errors" highlight the "psychological processes that underlie perception and judgement" (Tversky & Kahneman,1999, p. 582). Moreover, Kahneman and Tversky (1996) argue that cognitive biases have efficient practical implications for areas including clinical judgment.




  - Connectionism
    - An artificial intelligence approach to cognition in which multiple connections between nodes (equivalent to brain cells) form a massive interactive network in which many processes take place simultaneously. Certain processes in this network, operating in parallel, are grouped together in hierarchies that bring about results such as thought or action.

Ontology, ideology, and the Real[edit]
In developing a thesis of ideology and its function, Žižek makes two intertwined arguments:[8]

He begins with a critique of Marx's concept of ideology (as described in The German Ideology) in which people are beholden to false consciousness that prevents them from seeing how things really are. Žižek argues that people's deepest motives are unconscious and that ideology functions as a justification for the existing social order. That is, reality is constructed through ideology.
However, the Real is not equivalent to the reality experienced by subjects as a meaningfully ordered totality. For Žižek, the Real names points within the ontological fabric, knitted by the hegemonic systems of representation and reproduction, that nevertheless resist full inscription into its terms and that may as such attempt to generate sites of active political resistance.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Lyotard
  - was a French philosopher, sociologist, and literary theorist. His interdisciplinary discourse spans such topics as knowledge and communication, the human body, modernist and postmodern art, literature and critical theory, music, film, time and memory, space, the city and landscape, the sublime, and the relation between aesthetics and politics. He is best known for his articulation of postmodernism after the late 1970s and the analysis of the impact of postmodernity on the human condition.
  - Lyotard's work is characterised by a persistent opposition to universals, meta-narratives, and generality. He is fiercely critical of many of the 'universalist' claims of the Enlightenment, and several of his works serve to undermine the fundamental principles that generate these broad claims.
  - We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives.[19] For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of 'language-games' found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism
  - Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century B.C.E. The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment, and that a sage, or person of "moral and intellectual perfection", would not suffer such emotions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism
  - Epicurus believed that what he called "pleasure" is the greatest good, but the way to attain such pleasure is to live modestly and to gain knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of one's desires. This led one to attain a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear, as well as absence of bodily pain (aponia). The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism
  - Structuralism is a theoretical paradigm in sociology, anthropology, linguistics and semiotics positing that elements of human culture must be understood in terms of their relationship to a larger, overarching system or structure. It works to uncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel. Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn, Structuralism is "the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".

Postmodern:
Postmodernism is a late-20th-century movement in the arts, architecture, and criticism that was a departure from modernism.[1][2] Postmodernism includes skeptical interpretations of culture, literature, art, philosophy, history, economics, architecture, fiction, and literary criticism. It is often associated with deconstruction and post-structuralism because its usage as a term gained significant popularity at the same time as twentieth-century post-structural thought.
  - basically, modernity is ordered utopian, postmodern is chaotic anti-fragile
  - architecture:
    - The idea of Postmodernism in architecture began as a response to the perceived blandness and failed Utopianism of the Modern movement. Modern Architecture, as established and developed by Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier, was focused on the pursuit of a perceived ideal perfection, and attempted harmony of form and function,[12] and dismissal of "frivolous ornament."
  - urban planning: [GREAT READ!]
    - Postmodernism is a rejection of 'totality', of the notion that planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational
    - Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475).
    - The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993).
   - In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which capitalism could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).
    - Jane Jacobs's 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479).
    -  Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exhaults uncertainty, flexibility and change
    - A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60).

  - literature:
    - Literary postmodernism was officially inaugurated in the United States with the first issue of boundary 2, subtitled "Journal of Postmodern Literature and Culture", which appeared in 1972. David Antin, Charles Olson, John Cage, and the Black Mountain College school of poetry and the arts were integral figures in the intellectual and artistic exposition of postmodernism at the time.[21] boundary 2 remains an influential journal in postmodernist circles today.[22]
    - Jorge Luis Borges's (1939) short story Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, is often considered as predicting postmodernism

  - music:
    - The postmodern impulse in classical music arose in the 1960s with the advent of musical minimalism.
    - most notably John Cage challenged the prevailing Narratives of beauty and objectivity common to Modernism

  - philosophy:
    - Martin Heidegger*
      - Rejected the philosophical basis of the concepts of "subjectivity" and "objectivity" and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another
    - Derrida, Foucault, and more
    - Lyotard
      - As formal conjecture about real-world issues becomes inextricably linked to automated calculation, information storage and retrieval, such knowledge becomes increasingly "exteriorised" from its knowers in the form of information. Knowledge is materialized and made into a commodity exchanged between producers and consumers; it ceases to be either an idealistic end-in-itself or a tool capable of bringing about liberty or social benefit; it is stripped of its humanistic and spiritual associations, its connection with education, teaching and human development, being simply rendered as "data" — omnipresent, material, unending and without any contexts or pre-requisites.
     - [basically says that people take data from a unified sources (meta-narratives), say, Wikipedia, and then consider it reality automatically.]

Entropy
  - In thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol S) is a measure of the number of specific ways in which a thermodynamic system may be arranged, commonly understood as a measure of disorder. According to the second law of thermodynamics the entropy of an isolated system never decreases; such a system will spontaneously evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium, the configuration with maximum entropy. Systems that are not isolated may decrease in entropy, provided they increase the entropy of their environment by at least that same amount.
  - Cosmology / Heat death of the universe:
    - Since a finite universe is an isolated system, the Second Law of Thermodynamics states that its total entropy is constantly increasing. It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a heat death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy, so that no more work can be extracted from any source.
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropic_force
    - has an animation to demonstrate meaning
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(arrow_of_time)
    - interesting!

If the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then – as Sir Roger Penrose has pointed out – gravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into black holes. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's event horizon.[65] Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size. This makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes, if they are totally effective matter and energy traps. Hawking has, however, recently changed his stance on this aspect, in a paper which largely redefined the event horizons of black holes and suggested that the escape of energy from black holes might be possible due to quantum activity.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics:
  - Thermodynamics is a branch of physics concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. It defines macroscopic variables, such as internal energy, entropy, and pressure, that partly describe a body of matter or radiation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_physics
  - time, space, determinism, causality

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics
  - An interpretation of quantum mechanics is a set of statements which attempt to explain how quantum mechanics informs our understanding of nature. [the answer of the world by physicists]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics
  - Broadly speaking, pure mathematics is mathematics that studies entirely abstract concepts.
  - Another insightful view put forth is that pure mathematics is not necessarily applied mathematics: it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature, and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.[2] Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.
  - One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. [unity of all knowledges]
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory
    - is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers, sometimes called "The Queen of Mathematics" because of its foundational place in the discipline.[1] Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark:
  - an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter.
  - Quarks have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge and spin. Quarks are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction)
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model (of particle physics)
    - The Standard Model falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not incorporate the full theory of gravitation[2] as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the universe (as possibly described by dark energy). The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations (and their non-zero masses). Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent[3] and has demonstrated huge and continued successes in providing experimental predictions, it does leave some phenomena unexplained.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry
  - is the theoretical symmetry of physical laws under a time reversal transformation
  - t -> -t
  - Although in restricted contexts one may find this symmetry, the observable universe itself does not show symmetry under time reversal, primarily due to the second law of thermodynamics. Hence time is said to be non-symmetric, or asymmetric. However, quantum noninvasive measurements are predicted to violate time symmetry,[1] contrary to their classical counterparts, although it has not yet been experimentally confirmed.
  - time reversal is real!

Maxwell’s demon
  - increase in entropy
  - Modern analyses of this problem have taken into account Claude E. Shannon's relation between entropy and information. Many interesting results in modern computing are closely related to this problem — reversible computing, quantum computing and physical limits to computing, are examples.

    - The Hubert Dreyfus approach:
      - In critiquing the artificial intelligence (AI) programme Hubert Dreyfus (1992) argues that the way skill development has become understood in the past has been wrong. He argues, this is the model that the early artificial intelligence community uncritically adopted. In opposition to this view he argues, with Heidegger, that what we observe when we learn a new skill in everyday practice is in fact the opposite. We most often start with explicit rules or preformulated approaches and then move to a multiplicity of particular cases, as we become an expert. His argument draws directly on Heidegger's account in Being and Time of humans as beings that are always already situated in-the-world. As humans ‘in-the-world’ we are already experts at going about everyday life, at dealing with the subtleties of every particular situation—that is why everyday life seems so obvious. Thus, the intricate expertise of everyday activity is forgotten and taken for granted by AI as an assumed starting point.[26] What Dreyfus highlighted in his critique of AI was the fact that technology (AI algorithms) does not make sense by itself. It is the assumed, and forgotten, horizon of everyday practice that make technological devices and solutions show up as meaningful. If we are to understand technology we need to ‘return’ to the horizon of meaning that made it show up as the artifacts we need, want and desire. We also need to consider how these technologies reveal (or disclose) us.
  - basically, minds adapt to society and forget that they do, whereas AI does not.*

He suggests that the medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered through it, but by the characteristics of the medium.

Zizek:
he Sublime Object of Ideology, which disputed a Marxist interpretation of ideology as false consciousness and argued for ideology as an unconscious fantasy that structures reality. 

...

His political thought represents one of two paths of a progressive alternative—either a return to the program of socialism, which Žižek and Alain Badiou advocate, or the proposal of an alternative vision of social arrangements, which is taken up by contemporaries such as Roberto Mangabeira Unger.

...

In developing a thesis of ideology and its function, Žižek makes two intertwined arguments:[8]

He begins with a critique of Marx's concept of ideology (as described in The German Ideology) in which people are beholden to false consciousness that prevents them from seeing how things really are. Žižek argues that people's deepest motives are unconscious and that ideology functions as a justification for the existing social order. That is, reality is constructed through ideology.
However, the Real is not equivalent to the reality experienced by subjects as a meaningfully ordered totality. For Žižek, the Real names points within the ontological fabric, knitted by the hegemonic systems of representation and reproduction, that nevertheless resist full inscription into its terms and that may as such attempt to generate sites of active political resistance.

from Wikipedia of Yasujiro Ozu:
In 1917 he saw the film Civilization and decided that he wanted to be a film director.

In 1920, at the age of 17, he was thrown out of the dormitory after being accused of writing a love letter to a good-looking boy in a lower class, and had to commute to school by train

With his uncle acting as intermediary, Ozu entered the Shochiku Film Company as an assistant in the cinematography department on 1 August 1923, against the wishes of his father.

Like the rest of Japan's cinema industry, Ozu was slow to switch to the production of talkies: his first film with a dialogue sound-track was The Only Son in 1936, five years after Japan's first talking film, Heinosuke Gosho's The Neighbor's Wife and Mine.

Went through war, including battles.

During his time in Singapore, having little inclination to work, he spent an entire year reading, playing tennis, and watching American films provided by the Army information corps.

With the end of the second world war in August 1945, Ozu destroyed the script and footage shot of the film.[8] He was detained as a civilian and worked in a rubber plantation. Of his film team of 32 people, there was only space for 28 on the first repatriation boat to Japan. Ozu won a lottery giving him a place, but gave it to someone else who was anxious to return.

Around this time, the Chigasakikan[n 7] ryokan became Ozu's favoured location for scriptwriting.

Tokyo Story was the last script written at Chigasakikan. After that, Ozu and Noda used a small house in the mountains at Tateshina in Nagano Prefecture called Unkosō[n 8] to write scripts, with Ozu staying in a nearby house called Mugeisō.

Ozu was well known for his drinking. He and his screenwriting collaborator Kogo Noda used to measure the progression of their scripts by how many bottles of sake they had drunk. Ozu remained single throughout his life and lived with his mother until she died, less than two years before his own death.

Of his use of ellipses: Usually Ozu elides moments that Hollywood films use to stir an emotional reaction from the audience, thus eschewing melodrama.

Miyazaki:
Miyazaki aspired to become a manga author from an early age. He read the illustrated stories in boys' magazines and acknowledges the influences of creative artists of the medium, such as Tetsuji Fukushima (福島鉄次?), Soji Yamakawa (ja) and Osamu Tezuka. It was as a result of Tezuka's influence that Miyazaki would later destroy much of his early work, believing it was "bad form" to copy Tezuka's style because it was hindering his own development as an artist.

After graduating from Omiya Junior High, Miyazaki attended Toyotama High School. During his third year, Miyazaki's interest in animation was sparked by The Tale of the White Serpent.

After graduating from Toyotama, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University and was a member of the university's "Children's Literature research club," the "closest thing to a comics club in those days." Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.

In April 1963, Miyazaki got a job at Toei Animation, working as an in-between artist on the theatrical feature anime Watchdog Bow Wow (Wanwan Chushingura) and the TV anime Wolf Boy Ken (ja) (Ōkamishōnen ken).

Miyazaki's fascination with flight is evident throughout these films.

During this period of semi-retirement, Miyazaki spent time with the daughters of a friend. One of these friends would become his inspiration for Miyazaki's next film which would also become his biggest commercial success to date, Spirited Away.

In July 2004, Miyazaki completed production on Howl's Moving Castle, based on Diana Wynne Jones' 1986 fantasy novel of the same name. Miyazaki came out of retirement following the sudden departure of Mamoru Hosoda, the film's original director.

When Le Guin finally requested that Miyazaki produce an anime adaptation of her work, he refused, because he had lost the desire to do so.

In 2003, Miyazaki won an Oscar for his film Spirited Away but did not attend the 75th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles in protest of the United States' involvement in the Iraq War, later stating that "I didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq."

Many elements of the house have been the inspiration for scenes in several of his films. One example is the stairs in the household, very similar to the hidden stairs in My Neighbor Totoro.

"exploitation is not only found in communism, capitalism is a system just like that. I believe a company is common property of the people that work there. But that is a socialistic idea."[53] Nonetheless, he suggests that adults should not "impose their vision of the world on children."

In Miyazaki's world view, influence is supposed to drive the medium forward and although Miyazaki markets his own name brand well, he is nevertheless also critical of the godlike status bestowed on him. He has indicated that he sees such praise as stifling in stead of encouraging the exploration of creativity and the development of a personal style in younger artists.

Isao Takahata:
According to Hayao Miyazaki, "Music and study are his hobbies". He was born in the same town as fellow director Kon Ichikawa, while Japanese film giant Yasujiro Ozu was raised by his father in nearby Matsusaka.

from a Goodreads reviewer for Wittgenstein's biography:
Having read biographies of three great men recently (Jobs, Einstein, and Warren Buffett), it seems that the following are the keys to achieving outstanding success:
1. Be a genius at something
2. Be passionate about that thing
3. Devote massive amounts of time to that thing
4. Focus on it, and don't get distracted by anything that may come in your way - including other interests, family or friends.

from a Goodreads reviewer for Steve Jobs' biography:
- Remove everything that is unnecessary.
- Be ruthless about building an A team.
- Make stuff you believe in.
- Collaborate often through vigorous discussion.
- Push yourself and others to do the impossible now.
- Make great experiences by simplifying.
- Own your work and protect it.
- Live at intersection of intellect and intuition.

After reading so many books, watching films, the inevitable time to do something comes closer.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_ethic:
DIY ethic refers to the ethic of self-sufficiency through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert.

Rather than belittling or showing disdain for those who engage in manual labor or skilled crafts, DIY champions the average individual seeking such knowledge and expertise. Central to the ethic is the empowerment of individuals and communities, encouraging the employment of alternative approaches when faced with bureaucratic or societal obstacles to achieving their objectives.

The DIY punk ethic also applies to simple everyday living, such as:
  - Learning bicycle repair rather than taking a bike to a mechanic's shop. (See also: Bicycle cooperative.)
  - Sewing, repairing, or modifying clothing rather than buying new clothes.
  - Vegetable gardening.
  - Reclaiming recyclable products by dumpster diving.

Some educators also engage in DIY teaching techniques, sometimes referred to as Edupunk.

in punk culture:
So extreme was their desire for independence that they often performed at basement shows in residential homes rather than at traditional venues in order to avoid corporate sponsorship and ensure their creative freedom. Since many venues tend to shy away from more experimental music, houses and other private venues were often the only places these bands could play.

Riot Grrrl, associated with third-wave feminism, also adopted the core values of the DIY punk ethic by leveraging creative ways of communication through zines and other projects

Adherents of the DIY punk ethic can also work collectively. For example, punk impresario David Ferguson's CD Presents was a DIY concert production, recording studio, and record label network.

Skateboarding:
The most world-renowned, and probably first, DIY skatepark ever built was Burnside Skatepark…Burnside is the preeminent example of action.

A random bit found in Big History, by Daniel Lord Small:
His view is that culture and biology are highly intertwined, such that cultural practices may cause human brains to be wired differently from those in different societies.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Evolution_(book)
  - Chaisson argues that cosmic history can be examined from the perspective of energy flows.[1][3] He analyzes the flows of energy through various objects, and argues that these flows are relevant to understanding the relative complexity of these objects.[1] He suggests that a key measure for scientific analysis should be energy density per gram universe per second, and that analysis using this yardstick can be used to explain not only human evolution but cosmic evolution.[3] He sees energy as "work per unit time" which he equates with power, and shows how energy density in some structures has increased over time.[3] For example, in Chaisson's view, the human brain uses a much greater amount of energy, relative to its size, than a galaxy.[4] He suggests that energy lets us make "order out of disorder"


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_History
  - interdisciplinary approach to history, though feels like common sense
  - “chaos catalyzes creativity”
  - Christian believes such "radical shifts in perspective" will yield "new insights into familiar historical problems, from the nature/nurture debate to environmental history to the fundamental nature of change itself." [YES!]
  - It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, iron emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual
  - public intellectuals usually are polymaths, knowledgeable of the international order of the world, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, the institutions and laws that regulate the lives of the layman citizen, the educational systems, and the private networks of mass communication media that control the broadcasting of information to the public
  - The term "public intellectual" describes the intellectual who participates in the public-affairs discourse of society, in addition to his or her academic and professional affairs.[25] Regardless of the academic or professional field of expertise, the public intellectual addresses and responds to the problems of his or her society, and, as such, is expected to be impartial, and to “rise above the partial preoccupation of one’s own profession . . . and engage with the global issues of truth, judgement, and taste of the time.”
  - . . . “true” intellectual is, therefore, always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky
  - Noam Chomsky, an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, and political activist, attended Oak Lane Country Day School (a Deweyist school). Chomsky remembers the first article he wrote was at age 10 while a student at Oak Lane Country Day School about the threat of the spread of fascism, following the fall of Barcelona in the Spanish Civil War.

http://www.chomsky.info/books/reader01.htm:
QUESTION: For example, I am struck by how seldom you mention literature, culture, culture in the sense of a struggle to find alternative forms of life through artistic means; rarely a novel that has influenced you. Why is this so? Were there some works that did influence you?

CHOMSKY: Of course, there have been, but it is true that I rarely write about these matters. I am not writing about myself, and these matters don't seem particularly pertinent to the topics I am addressing. There are things that I resonate to when I read, but I have a feeling that my feelings and attitudes were largely formed prior to reading literature. In fact, I've been always resistant consciously to allowing literature to influence my beliefs and attitudes with regard to society and history.

QUESTION: You once said, "It is not unlikely that literature will forever give far deeper insight into what is sometimes called 'the full human person' than any modes of scientific inquiry may hope to do."

CHOMSKY: That's perfectly true and I believe that. I would go on to say it's not only unlikely, but it's almost certain. But still, if I want to understand, let's say, the nature of China and its revolution, I ought to be cautious about literary renditions. Look, there's no question that as a child, when I read about China, this influenced my attitudes -- Rickshaw Boy, for example. That had a powerful effect when I read it. It was so long ago I don't remember a thing about it except the impact. And I don't doubt that, for me, personally, like anybody, lots of my perceptions were heightened and attitudes changed by literature over a broad range -- Hebrew literature, Russian literature, and so on. But ultimately, you have to face the world as it is on the basis of other sources of evidence that you can evaluate. Literature can heighten your imagination and insight and understanding, but it surely doesn't provide the evidence that you need to draw conclusions and substantiate conclusions.
  - “Literature can heighten your imagination and insight and understanding, but it surely doesn't provide the evidence that you need to draw conclusions and substantiate conclusions.”***

QUESTION: But it might be very influential in making one sensitive to areas of human experience otherwise not even asked about.

CHOMSKY: People certainly differ, as they should, in what kinds of things make their minds work.

QUESTION: You seem a little reticent about it.

CHOMSKY: Well, I'm reticent because I don't really feel I can draw any tight connections. I can think of things that I read that had a powerful effect on me, but whether they changed my attitudes and understanding in any striking or crucial way, I can't really say.


early education:
QUESTION: What kind of schools did you go to as a child?

CHOMSKY: I was sent to an experimental progressive school from infancy, before I was two, until about twelve years old, until high school, at which point I went into the academic, college-oriented school in the city.

QUESTION: In New York?

CHOMSKY: In Philadelphia. That experience, both the early experience in the progressive school and the later experience in the academically oriented high school, elite high school, was very instructive. For example, it wasn't until I was in high school that I knew I was a good student. The question had never arisen. I was very surprised when I got into high school and discovered that I was getting all A's and that was supposed to be a big deal. That question had never arisen in my entire education. In fact, every student in the school I had previously attended was regarded as somehow being a very successful student. There was no sense of competition, no ranking of students. It was never anything even to think about. It just never came up that there was a question of how you were ranked relative to other students. Well, anyway, at this particular school, which was essentially a Deweyite school and I think a very good one, judging from my experience, there was a tremendous premium on personal creativity, not in the sense of slapping paints on paper, but doing the kind of work and thinking that you were interested in. Interests were encouraged and children were encouraged to pursue their interests. They worked jointly with others or by themselves. It was a lively atmosphere, and the sense was that everyone was doing something important.

It wasn't that they were a highly select group of students. In fact, it was the usual mixture in such a school, with some gifted students and some problem children who had dropped out of the public schools. But nevertheless, at least as a child, that was the sense that one had -- that, if competing at all, you were competing with yourself. What can I do? But no sense of strain about it and certainly no sense of relative ranking. Very different from what I notice with my own children, who as far back as the second grade knew who was "smart" and who was "dumb," who was high-tracked and who was low-tracked. This was a big issue.

Well, then I got to high school, the academic high school in the public school system, which was supposed to be a very good high school, and it was a real shocker. For one thing, as I said, there was the shock of discovering that I was a good student, which had never occurred to me before. And then there was the whole system of prestige and value that went along with that. And the intense competitiveness and regimentation. In fact, I can remember a lot about elementary school, the work I did, what I studied and so on. I remember virtually nothing about high school. It's almost an absolute blank in my memory apart from the emotional tone, which was quite negative.

If I think back about my experience, there's a dark spot there. That's what schooling generally is, I suppose. It's a period of regimentation and control, part of which involves direct indoctrination, providing a system of false beliefs. But more importantly, I think, is the manner and style of preventing and blocking independent and creative thinking and imposing hierarchies and competitiveness and the need to excel, not in the sense of doing as well as you can, but doing better than the next person. Schools vary, of course, but I think that those features are commonplace. I know that they're not necessary, because, for example, the school I went to as a child wasn't like that at all.

I think schools could be run quite differently. That would be very important, but I really don't think that any society based on authoritarian hierarchic institutions would tolerate such a school system for long. As Sam Bowles and Herb Gintis have pointed out, it might be tolerated for the elite, because they would have to learn how to think and create and so on, but not for the mass of the population. There are roles that the public schools play in society that can be very destructive.

college education:
QUESTION: What was your college experience like?

CHOMSKY: I was probably lucky in that respect. I never really went to college. I did finally get a Ph.D, and I did go through the first two years of college, but after that I did not really attend college, but after that, I did not really attend college in the normal manner.

I attended the University of Pennsylvania, living at home, of course, which meant several hours commuting, and working, mainly teaching Hebrew school afternoons and Sunday, sometimes evenings as well. There was no thought in those days of attending college in any other way in our circles, and no financial means to do so. The first two years of college were pretty much an extension of high school, except in one respect. I entered with a good deal of enthusiasm and expectations that all sorts of fascinating prospects would open up, but these did not survive long, except in a few cases -- an exciting freshman course with C. West Churchman in philosophy, for example, and courses in Arabic that I took and became quite immersed in, in part out of political interests, in part out of an interest in Semitic linguistics that derives from my father's work in that area, and in part through the influence of Giorgio Levi Della Vida, an antifascist exile from Italy who was a marvelous person as well as an outstanding scholar. At the end of two years, I was planning to drop out to pursue my own interests, which were then largely political. This was 1947, and I had just turned eighteen. I was deeply interested, as I had been for some years, in radical politics with an anarchist or left-wing (anti-Leninist) Marxist flavor, and even more deeply involved in Zionist affairs and activities -- or what was then called "Zionist," though the same ideas and concerns are now called "anti-Zionist." I was interested in socialist, binationalist options for Palestine, and in the kibbutzim and the whole cooperative labor system that had developed in the Jewish settlement there (the Yishuv), but had never been able to become close to Zionist youth groups that shared these interests because they were either Stalinist or Trotskyite and I always been strongly anti-Bolshevik. We should bear in mind that in the latter stages of the Depression, when I was growing up, these were very lively issues.

I intended to drop out of college and to pursue these interests. The vague ideas I had at the time were to go to Palestine, perhaps to to a kibbutz, to try to become involved in efforts at Arab-Jewish cooperation within a socialist framework, opposed to the deeply antidemocratic concept of a Jewish state (a position that was considered well within the mainstream of Zionism). Through these interests, I happened to meet Zellig Harris, a really extraordinary person who had a great influence on many young people in those days. He had a coherent understanding of this whole range of issues , which I lacked, and I was immensely attracted by it, and by him personally as well, also by others who I met through him. He happened to be one of the leading figures in modern linguistics, teaching at the University of Pennsylvania. His interests were very broad, linguistics being only a small corner of them, and he was a person of unusual brilliance and originality. I began to take his graduate courses; in fact the first reading I did in linguistics was the proofs of his book Methods in Structural Linguistics, which appeared several years later. At his suggestion, I also began to take graduate courses in philosophy -- with Nelson Goodman, Morton White, and others -- and mathematics -- with Nathan Fine -- fields in which I had no background at all, but which I found fascinating, in part, no doubt, thanks to unusually stimulating teachers. I suppose Harris had it in my mind to influence me to return to college, though I don't recall talking about it, particularly, and it all seemed to happen without much planning.

Anyway, it worked, but I had a highly unconventional college experience. The linguistics department consisted of a small number of graduate students, and in Harris' close circle, a very small group that shared political and other interests apart from linguistics, and was quite alienated from the general college atmosphere. In fact, our "classes" were generally held in the Horn & Hardart restaurant across the street or in Harris' apartment in Princeton or New York, all-day sessions that ranged widely over quite a variety of topics and were intellectually exciting as well as personally very meaningful experiences. I had almost no contact with the university, apart from these connections. I was by then very deeply immersed in linguistics, philosophy, and logic, and received (highly unconventional) B.A. and M.A. degrees.

Nelson Goodman recommended me for the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and I was admitted in 1951. That carried a stipend, and was the first time I could devote myself to study and research without working on the side. With the resources of Harvard available and no formal requirements, it was a wonderful opportunity. I did technically receive a Ph.D. from Penn in 1955, submitting a chapter of a book I was then working on -- it was quite unconventional, so much so that although pretty much completed in 1955-56, it wasn't published until 1975 as the Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory, and then only in part. But I hadn't actually been there since 1951 and had no contact with the university apart from Harris and Goodman. So my college experience was unusual to say the least.
—

kibbutz as anarchical society:
QUESTION: Was it after college that you went to live on a kibbutz in Israel?

CHOMSKY: I went for a few months when I was at the Society of Fellows, in 1953. The kibbutz where we lived, which was about twenty years old, was then very poor. There was very little food, and work was hard. But I liked it very much in many ways. Abstracting it from context, this was a functioning and very successful libertarian community, so I felt. And I felt it would be possible to find some mixture of intellectual and physical work.

I came close to returning there to live, as my wife very much wanted to do at the time. I had nothing particularly attractive here. I didn't expect to be able to have an academic career, and was not particularly interested in one. There was no major drive to stay. On the other hand, I did have a lot of interest in the kibbutz and I liked it very much when I was there. But there were things I didn't like, too. In particular, the ideological conformity was appalling. I don't know if I could have survived long in that environment because I was very strongly opposed to the Leninist ideology, as well as the general conformism, and uneasy -- less so than I should have been -- about the the exclusiveness and the racist institutional setting.

What I did not then face honestly was the fairly obvious fact that these are Jewish institutions and are so because of legal and administrative structures and practice. So, for example, I doubt if there's an Arab in any kibbutz, and there hardly could be, because of the land laws and the role the institution plays in the Israeli system. In fact, even the Oriental Jews, some of whom were marginally at the kibbutz or in the immigrant town nearby, were treated rather shabbily, with a good deal of contempt and fear. I also visited some Arab villages, and learned some unpleasant things, which I've never seen in print, about the military administration to which Arab citizens were subjected.

Now I had some fairly strong feelings about all of that at the time. In fact, as I mentioned, I was very strongly opposed to the idea of a Jewish state back in 1947-48. I felt sure that the socialist institutions of the Yishuv -- the pre-state Jewish settlement in Palestine -- would not survive the state system, as they would become integrated into a sort of state management and that would destroy the aspects of the Yishuv that I found most attractive.

But, if we abstract away from those factors, the external environment, it was a kind of anarchist community.
—


QUESTION: There seem to be in your thinking certain insights about society and intellectuals that span the course of your adult life. So much so that you are not surprised by what often seems to shock others. You are not shocked when intellectuals perform certain ideological functions -- you expect this of them. You are not surprised when American power operates by cloaking itself in an idealistic garb to conceal its pursuit of various interests -- you expect it of such power. And so on. Your insights seem less derived initially from prolonged historical observation than a sense of how things are expected to operate.

CHOMSKY: I guess I just always assumed it. It seems to me to follow from the simplest and most uncontroversial assumptions about motivation and interests and the structure of power.

  - Chomsky 2014 debate “Future of Humanity”

  - what can we do about politics (as intellectuals)?
    - initiate activism, even if one is a dissedent
    - what is an intellectual? A chemist who works 60 hours and the janitor who has a lot of knowledge of world affairs are not. A person who has the privilege of time to talk to people. It’s not a problem of will, not opportunity.

  - now that knowledge exists in technology, one doesn’t quite need the memory to know everything, exposition versus fact, what parts of this new technology should we keep and replicate and which should we refuse?
    - change from libraries to internet is much less a change than no libraries to libraries
    - the methods of gaining knowledge is essentially the same: keep what’s valuable and put aside the rest

  - what can we do about government spying their own country?
    - eliminate it
    - via direct activism
     - violates Constitution’s 4th amendment

  - but if US stops it, Russia and China won’t, and it put’s us at a security risk, so then what?
    - the role of governance is to provide security, but for who and from what?
    - there’s a trend that state policy doesn’t care for the security of domestic population, rather, it’s own state
    - believes there is no issue in stopping it [no more risk?]
    - references UN Charter, the foundation of international law

  - is there something that new technology brings in the form of knowledge? [as opposed to older methods: books and critical thought]
    - new technology brings illiteracy. Knows people don’t read as many books as before. People are less literate.
    - less literary references. Some say don’t need War and Peace or Proust. [I agree, it’s not needed].
    - preliminary study by cognitive scientists argue for stimulus hunger and restriction of attention caused by new technology
    - can increase and reduce learning, depending on use
    - it should cultivate thought and reflection, and if it doesn’t then perhaps this has to come back to new technology
     - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy
       - The primary sense of literacy still represents the lifelong, intellectual process of gaining meaning from a critical interpretation of the written or printed text. The key to all literacy is reading development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text.

  - how would an anarchist society look like? And how to communicate it to someone?
    - answer to question two: explain it
    - not a doctrine, it’s a tendency in human action and thought, and challenge legitimacy of authority
    - “power prefers darkness, if brought to light, it erodes.”* Uses woman’s rights as an example. It’s a constant ongoing effort to expand the realm of justice, freedom, independence, breakdown of authority, etc.
    - sees wage labor as a system of domination, compares it to slavery, as people in the industrial society and Lincoln felt. ~“If you sell what you make, you’re selling an object. If you are working for wage, you are selling yourself.”
    - enterprises should be managed and run by their participants
    - these things come natural. For example, if he asks his grandmother whether she was oppressed, she wouldn’t know what you are talking about, if you ask his mother, she resented it, which meant she thought she couldn’t do anything about it, his daughters are totally different, they won’t even bother answering the question.
    - steps toward freedom and away from illegitimate forms of authority

  - activism is tough, why do it?
    - that’s an argument FOR slavery!
    - other thoughts:
    - universities are the closest thing to self-managed society in the world, professors do what they want, it’s close to anarchist world, it’s why people take an academic position as opposed to business, it provides more freedom, freedom is the value

  - some question examples anarchism in history — French revolution and Lenin in Russia
    - Chomsky says neither are examples of anarchism, at no point
    - [I didn’t quite understand the rest, which explained his views of both examples]

  - where did freedom go wrong? For example, free market turning into commodification
    - free market is imposed to the weak (people), not the strong (state)
    - cell phone as example. Technology is funded by the state sector, for example, MIT. Apple [a private sector business] came 30 years after the research was done in the state sector. The reason is, cost and risk doesn’t matter in the State. Then if anything good comes out, it’s handed over to the private sector for profit.
   - the US doesn’t have a free market, neither does UK, Japan, or Germany. It is imposed but never followed.
   - the impositions of market principles destroyed economies, it only exists in the colonial world, in India and Eastern Europe
   - rich and powerful protect themselves from markets
   - western economies are financially based, 40% of corporation’s profits are financial institutions [huh?]
     - profit comes almost entirely from a government insurance policy — too big to fail (bailouts)
     - taxpayers pay 80 billion to banks, it’s class warfare

  - Russia, Ukraine, Crimea
    - violation of law
    - as was US takeover of Eastern Cuba, and they have no right, worse than Russia, because at least they have some argument
    - as is Isreal over Jerusalem, West Bank, etc. It’s because US is backing it

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory
  - M-theory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory.
  - More speculatively, M-theory may provide a framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory
  - Superstring theory is an attempt to explain all of the particles and fundamental forces of nature in one theory by modelling them as vibrations of tiny supersymmetric strings.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle
  - In particle physics, an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a particle whose substructure is unknown, thus it is unknown whether it is composed of other particles.
  - A particle containing two or more elementary particles is a composite particle.

    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark
      - Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei.[

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction
  - Fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces or interactive forces, are modeled in physics as patterns of relations in physical systems, evolving over time, whose objects appear not to be reducible to more basic entities. There are four conventionally accepted fundamental interactions—gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy
  - is a measure of the number of specific ways in which a thermodynamic system may be arranged
  - According to the second law of thermodynamics the entropy of an isolated system never decreases;such systems spontaneously evolve[further explanation needed] towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the configuration with maximum entropy.
  - Systems that are not isolated may decrease in entropy. Since entropy is a state function, the change in the entropy of a system is the same for any process going from a given initial state to a given final state, whether the process is reversible or irreversible. However irreversible processes increase the combined entropy of the system and its environment.
…
  - Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires understanding how and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial condition.
…
  - Entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J/K) in the International System of Units.

Interdisciplinary applications of entropy
  - Although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic construct, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including information theory, psychodynamics, thermoeconomics/ecological economics, and evolution
  - Entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an arrow of time. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a kind of clock.
 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time
  - Physical processes at the microscopic level are believed to be either entirely or mostly time-symmetric: if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true. Yet at the macroscopic level it often appears that this is not the case: there is an obvious direction (or flow) of time.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution:
  - 1979
  - The revolution was unusual for the surprise it created throughout the world:[24] it lacked many of the customary causes of revolution (defeat at war, a financial crisis, peasant rebellion, or disgruntled military),[25] occurred in a nation that was enjoying relatively good material wealth and prosperity,[15][23] produced profound change at great speed,[26] was massively popular, resulted in the exile of many Iranians,[27] and replaced a pro-Western semi-absolute monarchy [15] with an anti-Western authoritarian theocracy[15][22][23][28][29] based on the concept of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists (or velayat-e faqih). It was a relatively non-violent revolution, and helped to redefine the meaning and practice of modern revolutions (although there was violence in its aftermath).[30]

Alergian War wiki:
 - a decolonization war
 - Today, the conflict is widely regarded as a prototype of a modern asymmetrical war with regular military fighting informal insurgents recruited from the civilian population. The unconventional, often illegal and human-rights-violating counter-insurgency measures applied by the French military against the FLN, namely torture, forced disappearances and illegal executions, were widely regarded as militarily successful, but morally and politically weakening for the French position. Similar measures were later employed in a number of conflicts, especially during the 1970s and 1980s era of right-wing military dictatorships in Latin America battling and often killing any potential opposition in what became known under the Argentinian term Dirty War (Guerra Sucia). According to a number of sources, this happened with the official assistance of French military advisors and also exiled OAS-members. Early during the occupation of Iraq, the Directorate for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict of the Pentagon used the famous 1966 semi-documentary movie The Battle of Algiers as a show case for successfully defeating an insurgency and yet losing the "war of ideas".[5][6]

   -  “I do not hold to non-violence for moral reasons, but for political and practical reasons,"[50] however, nonviolent action as well as civil resistance in lieu of armed conflict are also political tactics in keeping with the overall philosophy of her Theravada Buddhist religion.
  - Aung San Suu Kyi has been placed under house arrest for 15 of the past 21 years, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career,[52] during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, Suu Kyi said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her.

Phenomonology (revisited):
  - technoethics:
    - Heidegger: “a ‘will to power’ that manifests itself as a ‘will to technology’”

curious of an artist philosopher’s life, I decide to look at Nietzsche’s and Schopenhaur’s biography. I’ve read Wittgenstein’s bio [via wikipedia]:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche
  - good in music and language
  - liked “obscure” subjects, scholars afterward deemed quite important
  - studied theology and philology
  - wrote essay “Fate and History” to disprove Christianity, then studied philology
  - thoroughly studied the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, and owed awakening to “The World as Will and Representation”
  - the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly
  - voluntary military service, performed well
  - became professor at age 24
  - served medical overly later in war
  - became increasingly isolated within the philological community [in my perspective, perhaps the community is isolated and he’s universal]. He remarked freely about the isolation. [great!]
  - his four essays, basically involve art (Wagner) and experience (Schopenhaur)?, polemics against standards
  - he isolated himself more from peers, became independent, going from city to city — summers in Switzerland, winter in Italy*, staying at friend’s houses, and for these 10 years he was most productive, publish a major section of a book every year, wrote 5 in the last year, wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra in 10 days [reminds me of Kerouac]
  - “Now, with the new style of Zarathustra, his work became even more alienating and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold.”
  - In 1887 Nietzsche wrote the polemic "On the Genealogy of Morals". During the same year Nietzsche encountered the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky
  - Was going to meet Kierkegaard in the Netherlands, but was unable to. [it’s amazing how Europeans were able to travel by land so much].
  - Mental breakdown. [Was his mental breakdown really madness? Shouldn’t people hug horses, and tell governments to shoot themselves?]

  - “evocative style and his often outrageous claims”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer
  - World as Will and Representation (German: Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung), in which he claimed that our world is driven by a continually dissatisfied will, continually seeking satisfaction.
  - At age 25, he published his doctoral dissertation, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which examined the four distinct aspects[8] of experience in the phenomenal world; consequently, he has been influential in the history of phenomenology

  - bio:
  - father may have suicided, mother moved with sister to Weimer, the center of German literature
  - began World as Will.. at age 28, and finished it after four years
  - “He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, whom Schopenhauer described as a "clumsy charlatan."[16] However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of academia. A late essay, On University Philosophy, expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.” [also isolated from acedamia]
  - “After his father's death, Arthur Schopenhauer endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant, in honor of his dead father”
  - disgusted at the vain of his mother’s salon
  - lived alone in Frankfurt for 27 years, with two poodles at times
  - had a robust constitution, only died within a year of heath deterioration

  - work:
    - Will..:
      a key focus is his investigation of individual motivation. Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of Zeitgeist, the idea that society consisted of a collective consciousness which moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members. Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires, or Wille zum Leben ("Will to Live"), which directed all of mankind.
      For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. "Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants"
      To Schopenhauer, the Will is a malignant,[26] metaphysical existence which controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena; an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: asceticism and chastity. "The world is my representation"

    - art:
      For Schopenhauer, human desiring, "willing," and craving cause suffering or pain. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation  (a method comparable to Zapffe's "Sublimation")

     - ethics:
       Only compassion can drive moral acts

     - physchology:
       addressed sex, and reproduction, foreshadowing Darwin’s theory of evolution and Freud’s concepts. [this is a good example where personal experience, thoughts, novel random ideas generated over one’s life, is valuable, and possibly not written about]

     - interests:
       Upanishades - “It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death”
       Buddhism - “Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire (taṇhā), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation”
       For Schopenhauer, Will had ontological primacy over the intellect
       In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either: personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.
       Also influenced by Plato and Kant, among many others.

     - influenced: Tolstoy, Wagner, Nietzsche, Borjes, young Wittgenstein,  
       Borjes remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him
        In later years (after studying philosophy of math), Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately "shallow" thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind... where real depth starts, his comes to an end"”—

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology#Acquiring_knowledge (again):
  - a priori and post-priori
    - Plato’s recollection of thoughts, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innatism
      - philosophical doctrine that holds that the mind is born with ideas/knowledge, and that therefore the mind is not a 'blank slate' at birth, as early empiricists such as John Locke claimed. It asserts that not all knowledge is gained from experience and the senses.
  - innatism - God or a similar being or process placed innate ideas and principles in the human mind
  - nativisim - Nativists hold that innate beliefs are in some way genetically programmed to arise in our mind - that innate beliefs are the phenotypes of certain genotypes that all humans have in common, grounded by (genetics, cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics.)
   - Chomsky argues for nativism, that humans are born with a universal grammar, to explain the extraordinary ability for children to learn complex concepts. His evidence is the common characteristics of all human language, all over the world (probably even in isolated environments).
  One implication of Noam Chomsky's innatism, if correct, is that at least a part of human knowledge consists in cognitive predispositions, which are triggered and developed by the environment, but not determined by it.*
     - Similarly, Wilson and Pinker, argue for fundamental notions of morality.
   - Example, a horse immediately knows how to walk.
   - “In a changing environment, an animal must constantly be gaining new information in order to survive. However, in a stable environment this same individual need only to gather the information it needs once and rely on it for the duration of its life.“*

  - notes: language is the source of knowledge, as Wittgenstein said. Chomsky argues for native universal grammar.

Social Determinism:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_reality
  - distinct from biological reality or individual cognitive reality, representing as it does a phenomenological level created through social interaction and transcending thereby individual motives and actions.
  - The product of human dialogue, social reality may be considered as consisting of the accepted social tenets of a community, involving thereby relatively stable laws and Social representations
  - John Searle has used the theory of speech acts to explore the nature of social/institutional reality, so as to describe such aspects of social reality which he instances under the rubrics of “marriage, property, hiring, firing, war, revolutions, cocktail parties, governments, meetings, unions, parliaments, corporations, laws, restaurants, vacations, lawyers, professors, doctors, medieval knights, and taxes, for example”.
  Searle argued that such institutional realities interact with each other in what he called “systematic relationships (e.g., governments, marriages, corporations, universities, armies, churches)”[8] to create a multi-layered social reality.
  For Searle, language was the key to the formation of social reality because “language is precisely designed to be a self-identifying category of institutional facts” - a system of publicly and widely accepted symbols which “persist through time independently of the urges and inclinations of the participants.”

Phenomonology, again”
  - is the philosophical study of the structures of experience and consciousness.

  - Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. This ontology (study of reality) can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.

All ages, free, and really fight for it.

After their first space died, they went on to do only festivals and big budget exhibitions, but then they lost their entry-level or entry to games, which is the space, hence Babycastles Gallery.

For people to makes games, you just need a space for them to make it and be happy about it.

Early artists have become big deals, and now they want reason for them to come back and make something for local culture.

He had a very good friend who said he couldn’t make games because he’s not a student anymore, he makes mass market games, and Babycastles somehow has to support people after school. So they’re trying to find other ways to fund installation type work, talking to galleries and commissions and maybe collectors, such as the Armory at Ace Hotel.

A medium, a culture, should be owned by people, and the closer it gets to people, the better. Babycastles has faith to bring games back the ownership to people.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism
when Googling for a a philosophy based on gaining knowledge:
Epicurus believed that what he called "pleasure" is the greatest good, but the way to attain such pleasure is to live modestly and to gain knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of one's desires. This led one to attain a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear, as well as absence of bodily pain (aponia). The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism, insofar as it declares pleasure to be the sole intrinsic good, its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from "hedonism" as it is commonly understood.

Existentialism:

free will

- freedom and choice (found in bad faith wiki:
A critical claim in existentialist thought is that individuals are always free to make choices and guide their lives towards their own chosen goal or "project". The claim holds that individuals cannot escape this freedom, even in overwhelming circumstances. For instance, even an empire's colonized victims possess choices: to submit to rule, to negotiate, to commit suicide, to resist nonviolently, or to counter-attack.

intentional consciousness and freedom:
Only in assuming social roles and value systems external to this nature as conscious beings can we pretend that these possibilities are denied to us; but this is itself a decision made possible by our freedom and our separation from these things. "Bad faith" is the paradoxical free decision to deny to ourselves this inescapable freedom.

Why I Write by George Orwell:
One cannot access a writer's motives without knowing something of his early development.

Four great motives:
Sheer egoism - desire to seem clever. Writers are vain and self-centered
Aesthetic enthusiasm - beauty in the external world
Historical impulse - find true facts and store them
Political purpose - push world in certain direction, alter people's idea

These impulses fluctuate with time [and place] and nature of person.

Driven by a demon one cannot resist or understand. For all one knows that demon is simply a baby squall for attention.

Looking back at his work, he saw that it is invariably where he lacked political purpose that he wrote lifeless books.

Atlas Shrugged:
Society's most prominent and successful industrialists abandon their fortunes and the nation itself, in response to new regulations, whereupon most vital industries collapse. Hence, the atlases (people who hold the world's weight, shrug).

Philosophy:
Objectivism.

Ethical egoism - do what is in their self-interest, moral
Rational egoism - an action is rational if and only if it maximizes ones self interest, no moral
Psychological egoism (not in the book) - act in self interest, within motivation

Individual life is purely a function of its ability, and that any individual could overcome adverse circumstances, given ability and intelligence.

According to Samuel Hugo Bergmann, "Kierkegaard's journals are one of the most important sources for an understanding of his philosophy".[34] Kierkegaard wrote over 7,000 pages in his journals on events, musings, thoughts about his works and everyday remarks.[35] The entire collection of Danish journals was edited and published in 13 volumes consisting of 25 separate bindings including indices. The first English edition of the journals was edited by Alexander Dru in 1938.[36] The style is "literary and poetic [in] manner".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey
In 1919, while traveling in Japan on sabbatical leave, Dewey was invited by Peking University to visit China, probably at the behest of his former students, Hu Shi and Chiang Monlin. Dewey and his wife, Alice, arrived in Shanghai on May 1, 1919, just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German held territories in Shandong province to Japan. Their demonstrations on May Fourth excited and energized Dewey, and he ended up staying in China for two years, leaving in July 1921.[12]

In these two years Dewey gave nearly two hundred lectures to Chinese audiences and wrote nearly monthly articles for Americans in The New Republic and other magazines. Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of Bolshevism to some Chinese, Dewey advocated that Americans support China's transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms, not revolution. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures, which were interpreted by Hu Shi. For these audiences, Dewey represented "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as "Second Confucius". Perhaps Dewey's biggest impact, however, was on the forces for progressive education in China, such as Hu Shi and Chiang Monlin, who had studied with him, and Tao Xingzhi, who had studied at Columbia School of Education.[13]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_russell:
In "Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday" ("Postscript" in his Autobiography), Russell wrote: "I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken"

Cartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in philosophy. This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy by René Descartes (1596-1650), who sought to doubt the truth of all his beliefs in order to determine which beliefs he could be certain were true.
Methodological skepticism is distinguished from philosophical skepticism in that methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims, whereas philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of pure knowledge.

evolution:
phenotype - genotype plus affects of environment
the selfish gene - gene-only,  Dawkins used the term "selfish gene" as a way of expressing the gene-centred view of evolution as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the group, popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others. From the gene-centred view follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other. Therefore the concept is especially good at explaining many forms of altruism.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection
Multilevel selection theory
By 1994, the limitations of earlier models have been addressed, and newer models suggest that selection may sometimes act above the gene level. Recently David Sloan Wilson and Elliott Sober have argued that the case against group selection has been overstated. They focus their argument on whether groups can have functional organization in the same way individuals do and, consequently, whether groups can also be "vehicles" for selection. For example, groups that cooperate better may have out-reproduced those that did not. Resurrected in this way, Wilson & Sober's new group selection is usually called multilevel selection theory

rb > c
(where b represents the benefit to the recipient of altruism, c the cost to the altruist, and r their degree of relatedness) should be replaced by the more general equation
rbk + be > c
in which bk is the benefit to kin (b in the original equation) and be is the benefit accruing to the group as a whole. He then argues that, in the present state of the evidence in relation to social insects, it appears that be>rbk, so that altruism needs to be explained in terms of selection at the colony level rather than at the kin level. However, it is well understood in social evolution theory that kin selection and group selection are not distinct processes, and that the effects of multi-level selection are already fully accounted for in Hamilton's original rule, rb>c,[25] provided that an expanded definition of r, not requiring Hamilton's original assumption of direct genealogical relatedness, is used.

For humans, a highly pro-social, cognitive thinking species, social norms can be seen as a means of reducing the individual level variation and competition and shift selection in humans to the group level. Wilson ties the MLS theory regarding humans to another upcoming theory known as gene-culture evolution by acknowledging that culture seems to characterize a group-level mechanism for human groups to adapt to environmental changes.[19] Methods of testing MLS include social psychological experimentation and multilevel modeling equations.

According to the set-point model, levels of positive and negative affects are more or less fixed within each individual, hence, after a positive or negative event, people's moods tend to go back to the pre-set level.

found that arousal and pleasantness are positivelycorrelated for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings are more likely to be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for introverts, resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if everything is going well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts see such situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. Yet, when everything is going good for introverts, they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content.

Practice is the act of rehearsing a behavior over and over, or engaging in an activity again and again, for the purpose of improving or mastering it, as in the phrase "practice makes perfect"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_coding_theory
Dual-coding theory, a theory of cognition, was hypothesized by Allan Paivio of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. In developing this theory, Paivio used the idea that the formation of mental images aids in learning (Reed, 2010). According to Paivio, there are two ways a person could expand on learned material: verbal associations and visual imagery.

Motivational theories also explain how learners' goals affect the way they engage with academic tasks.[44] Those who have mastery goals strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have performance approach goals strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have performance avoidance goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, creativity and intrinsic motivation. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and test anxiety. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.[44]

CET and intrinsic motivation is also linked to relatedness through the hypothesis that intrinsic motivation will flourish if linked with a sense of security and relatedness. 

An influential review article concluded that personality, specifically extraversion and emotional stability, was the best predictor of subjective well-being.

Specifically, the personality trait of extraversion is seen as a facilitator of more social interactions,[43][52][54] since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal.

The more frequent social participation among extraverts could be explained by the fact that extraverts know more people, but those people are not necessarily their close friends, while introverts, when participating in social interactions, are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships.

Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as[original research?]: an interactive, goal-oriented activity, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other.

"A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome."
A game is a form of play with goals and structure.
