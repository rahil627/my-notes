okay the following is rather overwhelming for an online dating message, but if you have time, please do read...'cause i took the time to write it!

i know you're looking for a long-distance penpal, but let's say i live in antarctica...and you know you can't have sex in antarctica cuase it's sooo coooold, so you're safe.

oh right, i'll start with the reason of this letter. ... i've always had a few close male friends, but never a close female friend etc. so i'd just like to talk ...

i don't like writing, but i am interested in the thoughts of other people, and how alike they are to me.
maybe this will be a chance to improve on my writing.
a friend started writing a blog, but i've never read more than one blog post, so that doens't work.

i think i approached in a very picky way, by looking for someone with similar taste (but different personality)

so i'm just going to jump right into the sharing

mention:
aspirations
writing down my thoughts
bikes - my childhood
pitchfork - name few favs/indie movies - name few favs/ metacritic's year end lists/
adventure
moving to another country/tired of america...although there are parks here, it just feels subarban

oh and after listenin to the new joanna newsom, i wiki'd it, and found "peach plum pear" (without cheating [googling])! it was at this time i sketched ideas on a .txt.

ha, now that you know i'm a ronery nerdy media whore, tired of current american suburban, ...oh right the only reason i thought of any of this was because of the time i had between college and finding a job - ~9months.

this is a petty attempt at redeeming my time, and prioritizing on more important things, such as what i want to do i the future, talking to girls, improving social life, etc.

hrm, so maybe this was a bad idea

this is very unlikely of me..but meh. well this did turn out to be a good self-description. i'll keep a copy of this.

guh, looks like i overworked this, like an overly long facebook comment on a trivial post.



if u don't read any of the above, could you help a nigga out on buying a bike? i know i'm going to over research it, i'm a product whore too. =/

again, i know you're just looking for a pen pal, not a gotdamn essay, but i just wanna know, how close your past and thoughts are to mine. very curious.

...



less serious:


herro,

i know you're looking for a long-distance penpal, but let's say i live in the arctic and that I have a pet polar bear. preeeeaase?

oh right, i'll start with the reason of this letter. I think my approach to finding new friends is wrong (anti-social/judgemental), but it works!

I only have a few friends (group title: fatties), but we share humor, thoughts/have good judgement, love food, have the happy gene, and have fun!

The approach is to find people similar to myself.

I found OKcupid by chance; the jew and romantic in me reacted.

Eventually, I stumbled upon your profile. it was concise, contained some cool media, and was silly!...and silly/ridiculous humor is my faaavorite.

Fine, I'll mention you are pretty too [I'm still iffy on mentioning this to avoid being typecasted as a creeper]. I'm just attracted to girly dresses....and fixed gear bikes.

I was going to to mention/ask more personal thoughts, but i'll stop here...in case you reject me (as a penpal!...that would be evil!).


OOOOOOOOOOOOOOkay, i'll stop thar. put on your business socks, you know what time it is. it's serious question time.

1) Could you recommend me a favorite DC restaurant of yours? My fatty friends usually eat large amounts of food for cheap, cause...we're fat (at heart)...but do mention anything. I've only been to Ray's Hellburger/The Steaks so far. I have one freind from DC who attends ODU, so I somtimes drive him up...for the food n events. He's on top of yelp and chowhound.

2) I just got my first paycheck, and I plan to buy a bike soon. I'll start researching, but maybe you know some good websites to buy or learn? I have a bike enthusiast(?) friend who will help me, but i'm a product whore, so i take everything into consideration.


Wow okay, going to stop now. you're lucky you obtained this second draft. The first one was overworked like a long facebook comment on a trivial post.

oh godamnnit...picture required 'O.O...reallllllly didn't want to be seen on a dating site.


no rush, no need to respond, no worries.

My Self-Summary
I just want to eat delicious bread, all the time.

Hate Virginia.

Love cupcakes.

I'll get to things eventually. I keep forgetting.
What I’m doing with my life
Spending too much money to become an art professor, so I can make very little money when it's all done.
I’m really good at
Doing my art projects at the last moment.

Waking up late. Really, really, really late. Dang it.
The first things people usually notice about me
Quiet.
My favorite books, movies, music, and food
Cookbooks.

Wes Anderson. Sunshine, Little miss sunshine, Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.

man man, caribou, maps & atlases, decemberists, devendra banhart, waxwing, soko, cocoon, a lily, modern life is war, mountain goats, animal collective, seabear, menomena, coco rosie, portugal the man, efterklang, marissa nadler, saetia, doesn't matter.

Healthy, except for desserts. I splurge on that.
I spend a lot of time thinking about
Food.
On a typical Friday night I am
Richmond.
DC.

Soon:
Baltimore, Philly, New york.
Trying to eat some tasty food, that's all.
The most private thing I’m willing to admit here
My dad used to rule our land. He had a fierce mane. Then my uncle came and pushed him off a mountain.

He was trampled over.
You should message me if
You do not take this site too seriously, except for the long distance penpals part. That is very serious business.

Does anyone read anymore?
Probably not. 




welp, sorry to bother you with the last message. It was spontaneous thing to do, and I felt it was worth doing at the time.
