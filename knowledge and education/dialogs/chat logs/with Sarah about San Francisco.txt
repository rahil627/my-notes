the best thing about san fran is that nobody judges you. You can be a gay midget belly dancer, and still nobody would even stare at you. I've seen old people rollerblade, an upper class chick give dap to a bum, and a dope dealer talk to a vietnam vet. Sorta just eliminates racism and classes
keeping?


yea, ridiculous events go on here. It was for an Edwardian Ball later that night, but the vendors were open to the public during the day. Very crafty people were selling sweet accessories'

ah yea, over LA/NYC/DC, i'd think so

food, artists, privately owned shops. Nobody judges you here. Although  people do look a lot more bummy...

well, there are bummy ones everywhere theres a city with people to beg
1:04

ah, i dont even mean just bums. People just wear bummy clothes. Many are broke artists
Rahil Patel @ 1:05

It seems very few people actually have money….or maybe everyone is extremely thrifty hah

Sarah @ 1:06

better than nyc where if you're not polished etc you better be a 'punk'
1:07

pffff
1:08

oh yea. People here are nice. They're fine with all types of personalities, probably 'cause they've seen them all! You could be a transvestite midget, and people would still wouldn't look down on you

Sarah @ 1:09

i've seen a drug dealer talking to a vietnam veteran about cars and higher class girl give dap to a bum!
Rahil Patel @ 1:11

a disabled vietnam veteran*

quite a different mentality compared to the suburbs
1:12

where goth clothing results in stares and gossip from everyone
1:13

don't really know if LA/NYC is the same way, but i imagine a little more materialism/business oriented and less creativity
