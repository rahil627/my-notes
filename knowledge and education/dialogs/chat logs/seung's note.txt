Last Wednesday I received this email from my dad:
Hi. Son..
How are you the bad news house economic situation getting worse.
We may foreclosure the house at this month.
My opinion is the get a job for Korean company is better than in here.
From now on learnKorean and Chiness and try send your resume to these companies.

Now I know it's been years since I've really told anyone much of anything, but rest assured it's almost exclusively been negative and going downhill. This was the last straw - no longer being able to pursue even psychology, which isn't even what I really truly want to do at the core of my being, because of money was not a possibility I could live with. On top of that, my dad's "grand plan" of forcing me to do stuff I don't want to and am not very good at AGAIN made my future look even more miserable than it did before.

So I decided, that day, I was going to kill myself (this would be the second attempt on my life for those of you who don't know...which is most) within the week

I started up a Deathswitch account and began writing my suicide letter that I would have had a friend send out to anyone I might have known. I didn't expect my letter to be so hard to write. To describe everything I've felt and thought throughout my entire life is a rather daunting task. By the time I had written enough about my family that I'd gotten so depressed I wanted to off myself then and there without even finishing, I was already at 4 pages.

A few days passed and my dad kept calling me. He even woke me up at 8 goddamn 40 am today after I went to bed at 5am. I've yet to answer the phone or reply to an email. As far as he knows, I've been dead since Wednesday. I don't think I can face him, I don't know what to say to him, and I don't know what will happen to my family or me.

So today I decided was going to be the day. I'd previously gone to the parking garage and looked at how far of a drop I would be enduring, unable to decide between choosing a height more likely to kill me or one to merely break my legs which would ultimately lead to me being submitted to a mental hospital. I knew some part of me wanted to remain alive, if broken, as a call for help and attention. I wanted to be the person in the hospital with an entire crowd coming to visit me. I wanted old friends and those I held the closest to my heart, whether I do now or not, to come and reconnect and offer a helping hand like they did so many times before. I wanted her to come.

But the more I thought about it, the more I knew it would just be more hell. I probably wouldn't be able to do much in the hospital and I wouldn't be allowed out to revel in the entertainment I enjoy so much. And I knew, most of all, that because of distance and obligations, my family would be the first to see me rather than anyone I actually care about.

I worked on my letter all day today, trying to take breaks and watch comedies or listen to old upbeat music I've ignored for so long to try and keep my spirits up. One hour ago I had just started my 9th page and still had so much more to say. I took a break and got a bag of chips and refilled my water bottle, sat in the dark in one of the student lounge chairs, tuned into the Fourcast podcast on my mp3 player, and ate. For some reason I decided to get some Famous Amos cookies as well since, well, I don't have them often and there was a chance it was my last opportunity to do so. 

And as I was nearing the bottom of the bag, chomping on the cookie and enjoying the few bites with three or more chocolate chips, I thought to myself "this is a good cookie." And, perhaps it's because I'd spent so much energy planning it all, perhaps because it was a loooong time until 5am when I'd planned to jump to minimize chances of traumatizing too many people while maximizing chances of catching someone's attention before i bled out, perhaps because I made the mistake of looking down the window once more and remembering just how scared of heights I was, or perhaps it was because this episode of Fourcast was particularly funny, but so much of the urge to kill myself suddenly faded away.

There's a guy named Muhammad I met at the beginning of the semester after we somehow managed to run into each other 4 different times at 4 different places on the same day. He is, frankly, a doofus. The way he talks and what he talks about makes me think he'll pretty soon become your average college guy. But regardless, after not seeing him for a while, he caught me and sat himself besides me. I don't dislike him, I just don't find my talks with him worthwhile, so I was pretty disgruntled when he sat down, especially when I was planning on killing myself within 12 hours. I saw the coincidence as a bad one: just my luck to run into him on the day I'm seriously contemplating suicide and having to try and pretend to be normal in front of someone who seems so happy-go-lucky.

But I was walking back to the dorm, I noticed a cute little dog running around the lawn and sidewalk between the dorm buildings. So I sat down on a bench and watched her run around while her owner sat across the field and kept an eye on her. To be honest, I didn't even notice her for a while since my eyes were on the dog the whole time. And while I had stopped to observe the dog, I also noticed how beautiful the clear sky was, taking the opportunity to close my eyes, feel the warmth on my skin, and relax as the sunlight made the insides of my eyelids a deep red. Occasionally when the dog ran out of sight, I'd turn my attention to the buildings, observing how big of a fall it was from the 3rd or 4th story windows like I'd done so many times in the hours before. But every time it happened I told myself to close my eyes again and just focus again on that warm red that seemed to be the entirety of my world.

It was a nice thing I happened to see on the day I'd made my decision. It had been a while since I'd seen a dog on campus and it was the first time one of them had come up to me where I could pet her. It was a good day to die

But now I see, maybe it was enough to make me reverse my decision to jump. Maybe, as annoying as Muhammad was, the fact that someone felt the need to sit down next to me and talk was enough to evoke whatever feelings I needed to feel to change my mind. Maybe seeing the pure joy and innocence of a cute dog running around under a beautiful clear sky showed me that it's the little things in life that are truly worth living for....Or maybe Famous Amos cookies are just really really good

Whatever it was/is, despite the fact that I stopped believing in God years ago because of the horrors my family went through during our religious years, I am thankful for those coincidences that happened to me today. This note is probably rambling and makes absolutely no sense, but I think it shows how little even I know about what went on today in my head. And as I found out while logging in to write this, it's my roommate Max's birthday today. We're not the best roommates to each other, but I'd certainly hate to have him get word of my death on his birthday.

So for now, my suicide letter stays at 8 pages. I've written a lot of stuff I've told very few people about and it's stuff I gave up on telling new people about ages ago. I'm deciding whether or not to post it publicly, but if you'd like to know what led to this day or who I REALLY am, I'd be happy to share it with you.

I still don't think I have a happy future ahead of me. I honestly don't. My life is lonely and more than anything I simply want a person to love and to love me back. I know it probably will never get any better, and I know I'll have to put up with a broken family for years to come. But for whatever reason, what happened today happened. And now I think I'll finally have the courage to reach out for help, if not to my friends, to the staff here at ODU. I'll visit the counseling services center sometime this week

I don't know if anyone will read this, and if they do, if they'll care or not, but know that while I don't believe I can ever have a truly happy life, I think now I can try to at least have a life.
