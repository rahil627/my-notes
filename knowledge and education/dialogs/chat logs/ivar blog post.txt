So one of the things I regret most in the world is that I never kept a journal as a kid. One because I din’t think I wrote very well or concisely. Is that even the right word to use? Also, I didn’t think that people would really be interested to read something I wrote. Why write something that no one wants to read but you? Sounds arrogant and self centered when I spin it that way. Also, I was lazy. Journals need some sort of effort at the end of the night. My nights as a kid usually involved masturbating and video games.  My nights now consist of a p90x work out and jerking off till I fall asleep.
Solutions to those problems. One: Writing takes practice, and yes I do suck at writing, but it’ll get better or my comedy career is dead. Two: People do want to read what I have to say about things. Facebook has proved this to me when I’ve written my various notes on my life and my point of view in life. Three: My nights still consist of masturbating and work out. So I write in the morning at breakfast.  
We get to New York after a 6 hour bus ride. The bus went ridiculously fast for a fucking bus. I swear we averaged 90 miles per hour and I could feel the wind trying to rip me out of the window. We get there and the first thing I see when we stop is a peepshow. And the sign is literally at my face, in huge letters, screaming “PEEP WORLD 25Cent.” I laugh. This city is going to be fun.
I have a bad a attention span, my roommate hates me for it. we’ve been looking for a new place to live in new york. I went five minutes and then went straight to angry birds on google chrome. he saw me and said “you are helping so much right now.”
I was shitting like crazy today though. I think I went once or more every hour. I put the fear of God into these toilets, and my room mate. I feel bad for him when I take a dump, he has to be around listenning to it. I swear I hear him leave the room when I go into the bathroom now. LoL. Then his aunt brought home some Indian food. OMG that food was too good and so bad for me. As soon as I finished my second plate (yeah I have no self control), my stomach was like, “Really? That’s how it’s gonna be? Alright man….” Immediate shits afterwards.
We pretty much spent the day asleep and wandering the lil Korean town we were in. Got to the house around 9, fell asleep til 1. Realization, I still have little to no attraction to Korean women. I know it’s a thing for most other Filipino guys and girls i know, but I don’t see it. They are attractive, but I’m not attracted. My sister put it best when she said, “Asian women are cute, but they aren’t hot.” I swear she’s a boy, trapped in a lesbian body builder’s body. Haha she would hate me so much if she saw that. Good thing it’s in here only
Onto the subject of women, there are some pretty attractive women here, but i can’t help fixating on the ex-girlfriend recently. Can’t pinpoint the reasons as to why, but i think about her every day. It’s not even that I want her back, well of course I do that’s why I think about her, but these feelings are total bullshit and I hate them. It’s probably the prospect of sex that keeps drawing me to her. one of the reasons we broke up was because she was way more into me than I was to her, she was a virgin and I couldn’t take that from her and not reciprocate her feelings toward me. That’s just fucked up. I know we don’t belong together either because when we were together, I wanted to murder her about 70% of the time. When you spend a lot of time with someone, you start to see thier demons. And by no means am I perfect, I’m short, passive-aggressive, got crohn’s, dimwitted most of the time, slow, insecure, angry, narcisstic, etc etc. But insecure, arrogant, and racist and not admitting to be racist are not characteristics I want in the wife. 
But I also know it’s because she’s the blueprint now. She’s the woman I’m gonna base my relationships on, as I am to her (She tells me that I am the best kisser). I also know that all it takes is finding feels for another. Broaden my view of vision because I only see one thing at the moment. So you can miss her Ivar, it’s okay to miss her, but nothing’s gonna happen with her. Plus you have to work on yourself too, you are a jobless and careerless peice of shit right now. Women cost money buddy and you have none of it. Go do some comedy.

“If you can make her laugh, you can get into her pants.” -Ivar (I truly belive this. Doubt I’m the first one to say this, but I’m quoting it, god damn it.)
