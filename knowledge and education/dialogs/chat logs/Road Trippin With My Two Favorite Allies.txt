Road Trippin With My Two Favorite Allies.

Who are my two favorite allies?
you know, when you ask the question...the line takes on a totally different meaning. 
It loses the song to it. 
Its note. 
Behind it only lies the meaning. 
Who would I take with me...if I couldn't go back? 
I can't tell if it's just social mores occasionally echoing "God." Heh. God. What a lovely...asshole? Beast? Monster? Human Being? When I think of human beings, especially of human nature, I think triumphs in its display. The courtroom scene of Boondock Saints is a strange first thought but I'll take it. Inner strength. A love for yourself and your brother. That thing you call God is the bridge between people and their souls. It's an excuse for the weak to need something common to love to love each other. I wonder how we started? How "We" started. The mix of people and personalities. There seems to be but a few dozen types of personalities for all of our billions of people. Personalities evolved as the types multiply and mix. But isn't evolution need based? Was it a basic need of the first Men to have somehow complimentary personalities, despite them being conflicting at times? Is this how we're meant to survive? Is it a punishment? The constant struggle? Isn't that what Hell is supposed to be? Or do the righteous get to live without that burden? Are we the Final Draft? Are we a ROUGH DRAFT?? Do you have a personality? Like a human being? Can you react? Judge? Hurt? Love? Save? Damn? Consume? Deplete? Fulfill? Lift? Destroy? 

Lie.

Can you?

If you can't, then I don't think I want you road trippin with me.
