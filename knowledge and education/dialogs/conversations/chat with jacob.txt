Hows new york life?

heyo, it's cool
should be home for the holidays

Sweet.

I haven't decided if I'm going to stay longer though. The sublease ends on Jan 31, might come home for a bit, then figure out the next step.

Uhh oh time to backpack what did you say africa or something?

hahah, not yet 
I wish I could live in another country, but they require me to work a full time job, which I don't feel like doing right now
I've thought about teaching in Japan hah

Holy cow.  That would be cool
minus the radiation 

hah

Have you seen a bunch of the 99%'ers while your there yet?

but ultimately decided to continue to dabble in arts and figure our some career before i do all of that
naw
ohhh
lol yea
didn't understand the reference at first

haha

there's always protesters around. Was based at Liberty Park, but I think they got kicked from there?

I think so

I was there for the international day of action. Marched across the brooklyn bridge. Was nice
Some group was able to project a large image of messages, such as 99%, on the verizon building

Haha nice.

I wasn't there when people got pepper sprayed though

Internation day of action?  Who was that set up by?  The protestors I assume?
Hah thats good.
That probably woulda hurt quite a bit.

hahahah, that would have been crazy to see
uh i didn't read much into it, it just seemed like a good day to occupy


Oh okay lol.  For some reason it sounded like something I saw in an anon video.
I get bored and watch em :X lol

hah, i haven't seen any vids on it yet, but sometimes i check the website to see the current status of things
but yea, if I'm not deeply vested in any projects here, i'll likely go home, then back to SF

Damn bouncing from coast to coast haha.  Well hopefully you find something that sparks your intrests and you can dive right into it.

yeah hope so 
i'll be broke eventually!

 lol  oh!
Haha
one day!
Guess whos going to baltimore MD april 25th!
For Rammstein 

ohhhh niiice
that's so far awayyyy, April

I know 
got some nice seats though

sweet
I don't think i've been to baltimore

I've been once.  Think I stepped inside the espn center there
but didn't do much else was just driving through

yea
i've only been to bits of dc
cool, prolly has some dope places to get some foods

I'm sure sadly i'm workin on loseing weight.. Startin to become a fatty lol

noooooo
i'm probably the same size as i was since high school
nothing's changed
urgh, it's been interesting living here though, without a job or the intention to geto ne

I imagein.  You got roomies right?

hah yea. A close friend from ODU, and two others
he's trying stand-up comedy, so we're strugglin together.

Haha stand-up comedy even trying that requires some balls to get infront of a crowd and try to make em laugh.

yeah, this was also his first time basically out of his parent's house, so there was a lot to experience
but it's good, i recommend anyone to do it (given the chance)! Take two bags and move out. See what happens. I bet the usual outcome is that the experience pays off. Possibly learn to allocate time into more important things

Two bags a little bit of money and some room mates?

yep
just pick up some internships or part-time jobs if money is needed

Well I mean money would probably be needed quite quickly right?  Start paying rent etc

yea, definitely need some starting money =/

How much are we talking because it sounds fun honestly
lol

we stayed at my cousin's place and explored/apartment hunted from there
we're on a sub lease for $600 each 
it's a small 4 room apt in brooklyn

2400$ a month?

sounds right

Damn!  Time to get a 2 bedroom with 2 futons in the living room
Lol

yep
this isn't even like a real 4 bedroom. It appears to be some sort of warehouse loft turned into one
and it's not on Manhatten
so yea, pricey 

damn 

I normally don't mind apartment size, as long as it's in a good neighborhood with decent roommates, im good
i can live like a bum

haha ramen noodles!

hahah noooo, i eat pretty healthy though
grocery stores have a nice variety of foods to try
but yea, i'd def recommend living somewhere for a bit. Or even a backpacking vacation, or some helping some charitable organization in south america, whatever. Anything to get out of the suburb and start doing stuffs!

Yeah I really need to.  I've been trying to get out more and more pretty much just on the computer a few days a week and out of the house the rest of the time

nicee
oh weren't you in school for something?

I was.  That fell through quickly when I realized its definitly not what I want.  Then I got stuck at the.. wtf do I wanna go to school for?

loll
what school / subject?
glad you realized that quickly
i don't plan to school, possibly ever again

TCC and went for mechanic engineering

ahh

Was going to do Auto cadd and work on fire suppresion systems etc

o crazy
interested in that stuff?

but eh. It was more of an idea and definitly nothing I want.  Been thinking of fire science for maybe an inspector position for the city.   I mean I've done it since I got outta highschool its mostly all I know.  Dunno what else I could end up doing I would have to learn from the start.

nah man don't think so narrowly, you can do whatever you want
I've never made a film, i don't plan to go to film school, but im pretty sure i can make dope films
in the same way anyone can do anything, you just have to do it
you don't need school, just learn things on the way
the internet has the rest

Haha internet is the key to everything 

it really is hah

I'll take that advice and run with it I really just don't know wtf I would do.  That only things i've ever really said hmm I could probably do that is teaching history or math.  Another thing would be CSI.  I get hooked on those real crime case shows and love all the work put into solveing the crimes etc.  Which I know the tv shows make it look alot easier than it is.
brb 1 second

aiite

back

k
lol at CSI, awesome. I guess you sorta have to figure out what you're interested in, then make a small stride toward it

Yeah guess I gotta start sometime might as well start looking into it maybe a little schooling won't hurt.  I know they say you gotta either work 3 years as a officer to get promoted or have a 2-year degree

dangg, that sthinks
gladly to be an artist, all you have to do is say that you are one
there's no difference 

Haha well shit in that case i'm a artist 

lolll
yea, i guess i sorta had artsy stuff in the back of my head before my first job. I decided to try a programming job for a bit, see if i like it. Then move out as I really wanted to get out of Hampton Roads. Then get a programming job for money and try to delve into some more creative things
but that didn't work so well because full-time programming jobs equates to much more than 40 hours a week, and after every day I didn't have the time or energy to try anything else
so after my second job i sorta decided that if i didn't get an amazing game programmer/design job at a tiny indepedent studio, then i just won't get a job, i'll work on my own, pick up contracts if i need money
which leads to present time, and it's nice. Tough for some personalities, but much better than working for someone else

Damn. Sounds rough but atleast you're trying to do what you want and find something you really like.  Alot of people nowadays just jump into anything and go eh this is fine and settle either hateing or loving it

exactly!
i'd never want to do that

Yeah thats what I'm trying to get out of haha
construction sucks

yesss get outtt 

I will when I feel comfortable I was actually thinking next october sometime.  I can have my car completly paid off.

nice!
still work 40+ hours?
'cause i don't know how you dooo it

Nah just 40 hours a week
actually we are pretty laid back

ah nice

We are suppose to work 7-3:30 and typically pack up at 2;45
lol

sweet, that's good
any sorta creative interests? 

a little but probably not as much as you are looking for or thinking of haha.
I mean creating shit is always nice and fun

hahah aiite

but the ideas don't come quite as quick for me 
lol

i see. Yea it only comes to me when i'm away from my computer. Especially when travelling, in the shower, before sleeping. It's intresting

Yeah I typically think of em in the shower or driving when I can't write shit down
haha

exactly! it's terrible. I have to use my notes application on my phone

haha nice.

ah well, i'm sure you'll get there mang, just lay off the WoW 

I got one of them fancy phones need to get some apps like that myself
I know I need to

yea, i finally got a smartphone when i moved to SF. I needed it for the map. I still only have one application, Yelp! For foods

After this expansion I'm done with it

hahahah after the expansion

well they just started the last raid for the expansion yesterday
so about 3/4 more months
and closeing it down
next expansion is pandas!
fail >.> lol

LOL
pandas?
forreals?
hahah pandaren, i see it
wow
that's pretty low

Yeah
lol
jack black much?

hah
maybe it'll attract more asian players
some sort of marketing reason

yeah its asian themed
its such a casual game now.. Anyone can pick it up and just destroy everything

dang =/
i imagine the hardcore/more serious players are dismayed by what it has become
or left long ago
i sorta felt that coming when the first expansion came out though

Yeah
well BC was actually pretty good to me.  I really liked the instances and such

when a normal lvl 65 item was better than a purple lvl 60 one

but definitly slowly has become world of casual craft :X

hahah, where kids casually craft items
ah, i never got to play the first expansion

Ah  It was good.  WotLK was decent but you could feel the ease mode coming on

ahh
i played the original, up to 60, started a new character, then lost interest
i didn't even try playing horde because the they looked ugly (but probably had better players)

haha yeah
horde is typically better

8:03pm
urghh when does d3 come out
might have to ship my PC to SF for that shit
