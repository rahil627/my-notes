Also, my train didn't come to Penang. I took a van to Hat Yai, then was able to catch the same train. FUN!
I'm really loving the feel of Bangkok. The food is amazingly fresh, my hostel is in a residential area, I have a private room, and the nearby Chinatown is crazy packed. It reminds me of New York. A far better feeling than Kuala Lumpur.
Although I still want to do Ayyuthaya, Sukothai, I may stay in Bangkok for a bit. I just don't feel like sightseeing right now, I feel like filming!

Also, you should get internet on your phone. It's only 650baht unlimited for a month.
At least for DTAC (second largest provider) it is. I don't think AIS (largest provider/coverage) has an unlimited plan, just hours, which is still super cheap. It's totally worth the time it saves just on using a map.


Heyo, sorry about ditching you, again.  
That day at Muang Ngoi, I went to Huay Bo village. The guesthouse I stayed at was okay, a nice mother who ran it, but the brother was a kinda low-life male, drinking, smoking, coughing with buddies. In fact, there's a lot of drinking and smoking with the younger Lao generation. ANYWAY. So the next day I asked the other guesthouse owner about hunting (slightly mentioned in Lonely Planet). We went hunting and fishing the next day. It was awesome. Hunting for birds was a failure (I have bad aim), but the guns were sweet, and likely very dangerous. I had to stuff gunpowder down, insert a something to ignite, cock back, and shoot. Fishing was too easy. It just took one throw to catch two fish in a small lake. Then he started a fire nearby by lighting a plastic bottle. He proceeded to cook the fish, and we ate it. I also helped strip down bamboo for the rooms he was adding to the guesthouse. Good times in a village in Laos!
The next few days were spen in Luang Prabang. A complete tourist zone in Laos. And lol at the "French" food. Although I only tried Joma Bakery, it was meh. Chiang Mai has much better. It was however an awesome place to buy last-minute souvenirs for family and friends. Possibly the best night market I've encountered. Some really cool worn-out tribal clothing and antiques (though many copies).
I took a flight from Luang Prabang to Chiang Mai, then Chiang Mai to Bangkok, narrowly missing the purchase of a flight to India the same day, so I stayed in Bangkok last night, which led to my single negative experience, on my last day! -- a taxi driver robbed my iPhone. I really debated on fighting for it (he wasn't too intimidating, had a metal bar, and I had a better position behind his seat), but I guess I just didn't care enough, and slowly took all my bags. I went back to the place where I got the taxi (many taxi drivers were hanging out there), and no one knew him. A taxi driver helped call the police and create a report. I only knew the last 4 digits of the plate, not the first two Thai characters (damn alphabets!). I took the opportunity to just sleep a little at the police station and expect nothing from them.
Anyway, I should be off to India, likely today.
That's the word!
