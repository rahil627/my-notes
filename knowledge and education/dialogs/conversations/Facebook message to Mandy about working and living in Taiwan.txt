ENGLISH READING PRACTICE PART 1

MANDY!

I want your most excellent opinion.

Since my friend left, I've been pining for the times living in cities amongst a great community of artist friends doing things they enjoy. I find it difficult to finish projects alone, and very much rely on like-minded people. It's a shame. I should be able to create stuff anywhere, involve the people around me, and build a community wherever I am. My friend and I ran a game development workshop at a nearby small college in India, and I'm going to propose another event soon, but I suspect that my self-motivation will sink without enough artist friends. After a short trip to Nepal and northeast India with a childhood friend, I'll try to make some things alone, likely somehow involving the people around me. Regardless of how my personal projects pan out, I plan to move out.

And into a city. The cities I am thinking about are, in order: Taipei, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Paris.

Taipei because I love Taiwanese people, and Taiwan. I also want to learn Mandarin. I somehow feel at ease creating or joining a community in Taiwan. Hong Kong because people can speak English, allowing me to settle in faster, and take on higher level jobs. I believe it also has a more developed art scene (more progressive universities, venues, and organizations). Tokyo and Paris are pipe dreams in my mind. Especially Tokyo.

Once I move in, I'll likely gravitate toward doing the normal city stuff, you know: volunteer at organizations, start a new one, create events, make stuff with people, help people, develop a social network, get involved with as many things as I can. The goal being to create a studio.

Would you advise my move? Are those artsy kids from NTU able to speak English? Is the Taipei art scene too serious for my silly antics and experimentation? Or does Hong Kong make more sense?

Lastly, do you know anyone who could possibly provide some more info about moving in to any of these cities?

Oh yeah. I hope you're doing well. *begin Ching's voice* blargh blargh blargh *end Ching's voice*
