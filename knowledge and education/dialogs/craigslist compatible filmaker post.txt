Looking for compatible filmmakers to make short films and video with (Clinton Hill)

I'm trying to get into film, but don't want to take the conventional route of film school or production internships. I'd rather simply make films. I plan to buy an old DVX camera or DSLR and start making stuff soon. I plan to start small, entering short film festivals and advertisement contests (Tongal, PopTent, and FilmTheNext), and even gigs on craigslist! I'm looking for maybe one or two other people to make films with. We will be the director/writer/editor/producer/etc. We can hire actors as needed, or even use ourselves.

I do not have ANY film experience. I just have an interest and am going for it.

Although the intention of this post is to find a compatible filmmaker, I'm sure we can dabble in other medias. I generally find people into art, especially digital art, are multi-talented. I have a programming / video game design background myself.

Also noteworthy--I plan to move to San Francisco soon (March 1st/April 1st), but of course I'll stay until the projects are finished, or longer if it really works out. I'm quite flexible, but I still wouldn't want to start with a large project such as a documentary or feature film.

To narrow down compatibility it may help to check out my Facebook info page and my neglected blog.

Do you also enjoy Wong Kar-wai's cinematography, Lous C.K.'s Louie, the social realism of cinema verite films? Or perhaps you're into large graphics novels such as those by Craig Thompson, Chris Ware, and Alan Moore. As long as you're interested in something, I'm sure we'll get along.

I live close to Pratt University. I'm 24. And I love freshly baked chinese pork buns!
