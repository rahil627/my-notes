I've been travelling for the past few months, and decided I want to make some films recently. I will list some possibilities. I'm looking for anyone sincerely interested and wants to create something together. There is no pay.

Possibilities include:
music video with independent Thai musician a la Vincent Moon
- a live performance walking through Sampeng lane
- a live performance on a tuk-tuk in traffic
- a live performance in your favorite secret area!

performance video of traditional culture
- traditional music
- hill-tribe ceremony?

short film involving human struggle in Bangkok
- find people to film, follow them for a day, ask them questions about life
- iOS social game playing young professional
- prostitute (cliche, but enticing)
- last generation Chinese laborer (likely providing a fortunate life for their kids)
- hawker stall person

films of the crew's interest

It may help to provide some of my favorite directors that are quite similar to the films I want to make:
Hirokazu Kore-eda
Rahmin Bahrani
Edward Yang
Carlos Reygaldas
Wong Kar-Wai (doesn't fit, but goddamn it's beautiful)

I have nearly no experience. A few weeks ago in Penang I created a poorly made short film about a roti delivery man on a bicycle (I'm currently trying to upload to vimeo, but am having troubles). I used my iPhone 4s.

I now have a Zoom h4n, and hopefully a camcorder (likely prosumer grade -- Panasonic hdc-x900m or similar) soon.
