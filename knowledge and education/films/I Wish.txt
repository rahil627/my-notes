I Wish

The kid neatly cleans his room in the morning, such a good child

Grandmother uses media to practice yoga

Mother cooks in her kitchen

Japan's orderly urban planning shows, and so does the obedience of Japanese people crossing the sidewalk and traffic light

Why build a school on top of a hill? Good historical question, of space and place.

One kid lives with mother, separate with father. One kid moved many times, and has become used to it. No one place is better than another, Tokyo or some small island,8" it's all the same to kids.

The kids are very intelligent. But live through routine. Routinized, roted by education, such as swimming and commuting.

The kid is able to keep contact with his brother with telephone technology.

The main boy asks about desiring to go back to Tokyo because he wants to go back to Osaka.

Awesome little night market to buy Takoyaki. With these kids, it feels fun, like Lanyu, free to do what one wants.

Great traditional house shot, with traditional grandfather.

Memories, so difficult to forget. And things learned, developed with others.

Dreams as desires.

Mmm, memory of living together, desire of ideal.

Very natural home-life. One child / parent is more nature-bound, independent, creative, positive, the other more caring, city-bound, dependent, rational, negative. One child / parent needs the other.

LOL, this movie is fucking amazing. Time travel. So cute.

Such crazy beautiful nature shots.

Ah, so the parents went back to their hometowns, one with to parents, one independent.

Very cool dialogue from people who do the work -- mothers cleaning men's piss.

Shopping arcade food competition, like Taiwanese night markets. Marketing explained.

Such amazing screenplay.

Super boring-looking cities. "Calm" as the motherly kid said.

The fatherly kid is able to move on easily, make friends, live, unlike the motherly kid, who desires to be together. And through the parallel, one imagines the parents think the same.

One kid is so wild, trying everything, loving life, the other despises it, wondering why ash keeps falling, looking at a bigger picture, big ideas, the entire town, family.

Difference in wishes / desires.

The actress friend's mother wishes she worked harder in Tokyo. Working in the city, for more money, a better life?

Documentary / interview question shots of children.

The female, similar to the fatherly kid, hasn't thought far into the future.

Ouch, maybe stopped being an actress once she had a child.

Mmmm, the positive kid can't stand / only sees the negative, the negative kid only sees the positive.

The grandfather cake parallel is tougher to understand, an older culture, crafting cake, a lost culture, like love and family, kids becoming too independent, loveless, family-less.

The boy who likes the teacher gives up on his wish, too much competition.

Being selfish for desiring to re-unite the family? Can never know what the other wants. **"Do you care more about your vegetables than your family?"**

The fatherly kid is in denial. Says everything will be okay.

**"Even family will forget you if you don't see them, someday."**

LOL, "Hello mom?, I'm eating cabbage"...automatic response to overly-organized rational.

"I'm trying hard so we have fun"

The bike bell trick and vending machine trick are genius.

Learning language by doing / desire / self-motivation.

Crumbs, something shared by the family?

Mmm, a pet dies.

The fatherly boy, though independent, depends on his friends to remind him of love and family.

[out of order] The mother cries, being the rational one, upon hearing her fatherly son. She can't handle the lack of ideal family.

The fatherly son continues to have a feeling personality, full of joy.

Elevated tracks, such crazy good screenplay.

...

Mmm, chooses the world over family. Let's go of his desires. Parallel to lost love. It is a lost love, just a different kind.

The fatherly kid still wished for something else!

The actress girl is quite independent, confidence in her way in the world. Quite frightening. Mature, but frightening, to be motivated toward such a narrow interest.

(out of order) Even the friends kind of parallel in personality: oddball, sports, artist, family.

The fatherly boy wished for his father to do well, sticking to his own mind, as opposed to listening to his brother. The motherly boy didn't wish, instead chooses the "world" (to let fate decide). The motherly boy learns to move on. The fatherly boy continues to live, already moved on.

Haha, a little editing magic with the music crescendoing to cigarette inhale.

No ash. Oh well. The world continues, no need to care for ashes / wait for an eruption: learn to live in the moment, forget about desires and ideals.
