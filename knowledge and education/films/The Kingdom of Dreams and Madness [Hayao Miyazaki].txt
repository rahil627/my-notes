Takahata worked at Toei Animation, Miyazaki joined the company under his wing starting on the same films, Takahata directed, Miyazaki animated. They left Toei. Later, they made Heidi. Did some more, but left during production of a film [Anne of Green Gables]. Miyazaki ~”had to leave to make his own films”. But for his second feature, Nausicaa, he asked Takahata to be the producer. After My Neighbor Totoro and Grave of Fireflies, and Kiki’s Delivery service, Ghibli went to a salary system, with Suzuki joining. Miyazaki even once served as a producer on Takahata’s film (Only Yesterday?). After that, Suzuki produced for both of them.

Miyazaki then tells of how Takahata left the studio in “disarray”, and that he was mad.
  - lol, how weak, needing such order.



“…When we were making Spirited Away, even I didn’t know [what was going on in the film]. The way I see it, we may never understand them. What does one know about this world? When we were working for Tokuma Shoten, we didn’t fully understand that company. We were fine with that, so why worry about understanding films? **The world isn’t simple enough to explain in words.**”

“I have my daily ritual. Every day I use a massage brush, exercise, take a shower, go pick up trash, go get coffee, then I come home and eat. That takes three hours a day, maybe more. But that’s my life’s foundation. Within that range, I read the world.”
  - capitalistic ethic

“I don’t take holidays or Saturdays off, only Sundays. And Sundays are very busy for me. Every Sunday morning, I go clean the river.”

[He has a wood-fire stove! Actually, his “atelier” is very much that of Howl’s house. He lives alone? How boring.]

“I tried to document the Depression but ended up with snapshots of life as usual…but I wanted to keep pictures of ordinary days. Then I got bored.”
  - Miyazaki is bored of reality, and creates fantasy. He is super ideal. No nuclear power, etc, yet Ghibli manufactures so much shit through commodities. He only thinks of / is aware of simple media problems such as nuclear power plant explosions and earthquakes. Yet, what of the infinite cultural problems? He is a dimwit.

“I asked here to marry me, can’t back out.”

“You know, people who design airplanes and machines. No matter how much they believe what they do is good. The winds of time eventually turn them into tools of industrial civilization. It’s never unscathed. They’re cursed dreams. Animation too. **Today, all of humanity’s dreams are cursed somehow. Beautiful yet cursed dreams.**”
  - mmm, **simply dreams of making things, but doesn’t want to deal with the results of it in industrial civilization.**



**only those who choose the right people to work with will be able to do the work they want.**
  - Suzuki’s advice to new employees of some television company
  - hmmm, what about teaching others to come your way?



…Suddenly, there in your humdrum town is a magical movie. Isn’t it fun to see things that way? Feels like you could go somewhere far beyond. Maybe you can.
