After finding both The Iliad and Odyssey a too far from reality (even the magnificent translation can’t save that), I decided to not read any of the books entirely from the Literature Humanities of the Core Curriculum (perhaps save Plato’s Symposium) and instead, read the Wikipedia articles from them, and writing my notes about them in this in this note, or for more detailed analysis, in notes in this folder.

Literature Humanities:
The Iliad by Homer
  - see text file
Odyssey by Homer
  - see text file

Oresteia by Aeschylus
  - trilogy [supposed to be four] of Greek tragedies (play) — Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, The Eumenides, [Proteus]
  - A principal theme of the trilogy is the shift from the practice of personal vendetta to a system of litigation
  - ugh hate plays, skipping

Oedipus the King by Sophocles
  - Oedipus Rex chronicles the story of Oedipus, a man who becomes the king of Thebes- whilst in the process unwittingly fulfilling a prophecy that he would murder his father Laius and marry his mother Jocasta.
  - The play is an example of a classic tragedy, noticeably containing an emphasis on how Oedipus's own faults contribute to the tragic hero's downfall, as opposed to having fate be the sole cause.
  - ugh, sounds trope, skipping

Madea by Euripides
  - based upon the myth of Jason and Medea and first produced in 431 BCE. The plot centers on the barbarian protagonist as she finds her position in the Greek world threatened, and the revenge she takes against her husband Jason who has betrayed her for another woman.
  - meh skipping.

- these past three tragedians aren’t much different from many dramatic books, television shows, and films. Cool back then, but after experiencing much dramatic films that convey these things better in contemporary times, there’s not much reason to even check the plot. Though, it is getting interesting to dissect plots in terms of action. Wikipedia turned out to be a great idea.

The Histories by Herodotus:
  - established study of history. [Because it was so great?]
  - Herodotus seems to have traveled extensively around the ancient world, conducting interviews and collecting stories for his book. [Indeed a documentarian, interested in the current world affairs, and of other people.]
  - Herodotus’s reason “This is the showing-forth of the inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that neither what has come to be from man in time might become faded, nor that great and wondrous deeds, those shown forth by Greeks and those by barbarians, might be without their glory; and together with all this, also through what cause they warred with each other.” [so he was interested in the cause of war]
  - Looking over the book’s synopsis, it goes over more than just history of wars, but also of geography, culture, biology (animals), poets, kings, inhabitants from far away, compares countries, introduction of technology (writing).
  - from Amazon’s description: With a wealth of information about ancient geography, ethnography, zoology, comparative anthropology, and much else, The Histories is also filled with bizarre and fanciful stories.
  - from a reviewer on Amazon: 1. How Persia becomes a military power. 2. The conquest of Egypt by Persia. 3. Two attempts to conquer Greece and why they failed.
  - [Hah, I think this guy was just an awesome explorer, traveler, interested in everything, documenting along the way.]

History of Peloponnesian War by Thucydides:
  - Thucydides has been dubbed the father of "scientific history" because of his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis in terms of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work.
  - He has also been called the father of the school of political realism, which views the relations between nations as based on might rather than right
  - His text is still studied at advanced military colleges worldwide
  - Melian dialogue remains a seminal work of international relations theory.
  - More generally, Thucydides showed an interest in developing an understanding of human nature to explain behaviour in such crises as plague, massacres, as in that of the Melians, and civil war.

  - Using his status as an exile from Athens to travel freely among the Peloponnesian allies, he was able to view the war from the perspective of both sides. 

  - His intention was to write an account of the events of the late fifth century which would serve as "a possession for all time"
  - Thucydides places a high value on eyewitness testimony and writes about events in which he himself probably took part. He also assiduously consulted written documents and interviewed participants about the events that he recorded. Unlike Herodotus, whose stories often teach that a foolish arrogance invites the wrath of the gods, Thucydides does not acknowledge divine intervention in human affairs.
  - Thucydides omits discussion of the arts, literature or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he himself grew up. He saw himself as recording an event, not a period, and went to considerable lengths to exclude what he deemed frivolous or extraneous.

  - Scholars traditionally view Thucydides as recognizing and teaching the lesson that democracies need leadership, but that leadership can be dangerous to democracy.

  - Nietzsche said, “"My recreation, my predilection, my cure, after all Platonism, has always been Thucydides. Thucydides and perhaps Machiavelli's principe are most closely related to me owing to the absolute determination which they show of refusing to deceive themselves and of seeing reason in reality – not in "rationality," and still less in "morality." There is no more radical cure than Thucydides for the lamentably rose-coloured idealisation of the Greeks... His writings must be carefully studied line by line, and his unuttered thoughts must be read as distinctly as what he actually says. There are few thinkers so rich in unuttered thoughts... Thucydides is the great summing up, the final manifestation of that strong, severe positivism which lay in the instincts of the ancient Hellene. After all, it is courage in the face of reality that distinguishes such natures as Thucydides from Plato: Plato is a coward in the face of reality – consequently he takes refuge in the ideal: Thucydides is a master of himself – consequently he is able to master life.” [awesome, a realist confirming an older realist]
