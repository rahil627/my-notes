1. The Shores of the Cosmoc Ocean
Intro:
How we've achieved to come to understand the cosmos. How the cosmos l evolution has come and shaped our culture. And what our fate may be.

From half way across known universe to Earth:
Quasar - billions of suns?
Pulsar - lighthouse like sun spinning, star dying, start stuff emitting
Spiral Galaxy - entire galaxy slowly revolves
Red giants (star) - likely to die young
Yellow dwarfs (star) - the sun, middle aged, may have planetary systems
Orian Nebula - orian belt (three stars), with a place to birth stars in it
Steller Nursary - cloudy place, birth stars
Pleiades - fledgling stars, with wisps of nebulas
Black ink blots - organic matter and ice, inside stars begin to turn on, create comet like tails, driven back by streller winds, organic molecules are easily made*

History:
Aristhostanes - astrologist, mathmetician used two wells, noticed difference in times of shadow in both. How? Marked it without reason? Calculated distance between two locations, the difference in shadow time, to get approximate angle from earth crust, then calculated the circumference of earth.

In library of Alexandria 0AD - all knowledge was within it.* one million scrolls.

Cosmos - greek for the order for the universe

Euclid
Dionysius - defined parts of speech
Archimedes - mechanical genius until Leonardo Da Vinci
Ptolemy - earth centered universe for 1500 years
Aristarkos - argued against it, had earth as a planet revolving around he sun, but his work wasn't found until recently. Crazy!
Berrosis - wrote a history of earth!
And others...

Alexandria was destroyed, dark ages followed, Renassiance involved rediscovery of ancient works -- those found at the library, 

Kepler found Aristarkus's work, Copernicus. Age of Enlightenment.

Age of Milky Way: 13 billion years.
Age of Earth: 4.5 billion years.
