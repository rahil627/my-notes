Ep 8: Tariq Ali / Noam Chomsky

Cairo inspired movements
  - Arab Spring infectious
  - tech-savvy, social media, 4/6 movement
  - moment of opening
  - rapidity of uprising made counter unsuccessful

Latin America did well to free itself from Western state powers
  - technology of 1970's

*Are countries that we too understand the problem?

**Bolivia
  - indigenous peoples moved to politics to take power
    - Ecuador and Peru too

Tech -> efficient industry -> dominate
  - most effective dominates?
    - totalitarian capitalism?
    - Chomsky says no, it's a slow process to develop

Problem is U.S is mitarily strong, whereas others are economically strong (think RTS games)

Active -> hope
Passivity -> despair
