goals:
write philosophies based on your life*
  - write on specific topics of interest
    - write without reading others’ philosophies
      - I think I have the most knowledge in game, film, new media, interactive art
      - I also think I have substantial knowledge with dealing as a Schizoid
        - hypomania, hypomania and language learning, irrational and rational, etc.
      - write as a way to make further inquiries, list all unanswered questions in one blog post
      - create another blog post that covers what I think are my most prominent writings
    - research and extend modern theories
philosophy through film
  - a series of khan academy videos using film scenes that non-verbally invokes the viewer to inquire philosophical questions
   - cone of learning

use my empirical knowledge (travel, art) to write about:
psychology - 1. dopamine and creativity, 2. hypomania and the apex of creativity*
modern complex theories: 3. creativity (on top of honing theory)*, happiness
games, play, learning*****
  - helps Parson’s
    - helps me find collaborators
  - blog game designs*
    - can be quick, no need for in-depth design, like Keita Takahashi
  - blog manifesto
    - see old manifestos, published and unpublished (on paper)
  - read NYU dude’s papers*
  - thought experiments
    - leads to game designs
    - game manifestos
  - ideal life through play
  - extroversion, creativity, and language learning
anthropology - people in mountains, climate, islands

http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-most-important-philosopher-of-the-past-200-years.html

skim through philosophy
  - need Bertrand Russell’s book again!
  - see http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon
  - not a good goal because it has no action, but can be considered learning
  - too old, can focus on modern concepts such as happiness and consciencenouss

Neitzsche
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche
  - confronted the reality of morality, Beyond Good and Evil - everything in between morality, art, suffering, bad parts of life is a part of life (Apollonian and Dionysian)
  - death of god
  - will to power - creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world, as opposed to survival

language and language-games, especially Wittgenstein
  - Philosophical Investigations*

thought experiments*

Why were the ancient Greeks so smart?
  - only ones to preserve writings?
  - were Aztec and Incas as smart?
  - Great achievements have more to do with political stability, good economy, and a favourable cultural setting.
