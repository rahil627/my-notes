Professor Rick Roderick

<thoughts from second read in angle brackets>
{thoughts from third read in braces}

search unconditioned knowledge - analytic philosophy (math and logic). Does not solve any real philosophical problems, just ones that were created by philosophers.

Start without knowing why human nature is. A common and absolutely insidious fallacy, promulgated by especially a capitalistic society, in order for people to function in the state and economy.*
  - <very relative for my recent life back to condition myself to be a part of the economy>

Can study cosmos because it IS ordered, not chaos.

In Greek society, forums are public. In our society, what shapes it, is private.

In a free society, people argue what society should be.

Greek life used social life to search for knowledge., dialogs. Nowadays, after Descartes people introspect for knowledge, talking to self.

The professor said no one reads books so have a movie example. :)

One can have all of the other knowledge without knowing oneself.

Today saturated with so much information, distinguishable from knowledge and wisdom. We're told who we are given a set of roles.

Used a yuppie as an example of how strange and distant the Socratic historical knowledge from modern society.

Sophist taught things, social sciences.

human values

socrates
  - beauty, courage, justice, etc.
  - dogmatic

protagerus
man is the knowledge of all things
  - opinion construct knowledge
  - each tribe and culture is the standard, relativism
  - Socrates doesn't think knowledge comes from opinion.
man is the knowledge of all things:
  - individuals are the bases of all knowledge. It's all opinions.

Socrates questioned people, smart people, passionately.

Passionately wants to understand humans.

Socrates doesn't think knowledge comes from opinion.

Sophists say that's not right, because we have common knowledge. Men are nodes of a common knowledge.

  - or, relativism: each tribe and culture is the standard

The professor doesn't believe this entirely, because he believes there are absolute truths.*
--

Trial and Death of Socrates:
Socrates felt value could be derived from talking. Not just certain things, but just talking.

He wanted to get at the meanings of ideas: truth, justice, etc.

[Self-referential argument by Socrates that I didn't understand.]

Hard to imagine a public citizen to talk to professionals now.

What are you doing? It's a good question. And it's good to have an answer. Socrates presumption is that if you think about it long enough, you might be unsure.

Artists usually can't answer that question.
--

Greek civilization is ancient, and still can only understand pieces through texts, or a time machine.

After the Polypennesian War, people struggled to find meaning, confused about life, an insecure time.*

People want society to NOT be confusing. People shouldn't think about whether or not one is a man, woman, or patriot is.

Does believe in eternal values (absolute truths), and that it is important to search for them, because he thinks current ones suck.

Considers current moment dark. Vietnam War?

Socrates questioned people, smart people, passionately. Passionately wants to understand humans. What does it mean to be human?

The professor is not an absolutist or relativist, but a fallabalist. He passionately believes in things, yet knows that in another view that belief may not be right. He wants to always pursue inquiry.

Jokes about how television talks about the same things and can predict it, because the knowledge is so limited.

Socratic life of inquiry, not as active, or political, but just an understanding of people.

The way we describe, understand ourselves is how we live them.*

Not just eternal, values but localizable, and usable. [didn't quite understand]

2. Epicurean, Stoic, Skeptics
Virtue ethics, basically ways to live:
[Greek] Excellence, all-arounder.
[Roman] Hedonism - do what makes you happy
How can do the right thing web hedonism?
Higher hedonism and lower. Higher has no negative affect, eat expensive food. Lower has an effect, drugs, girlfriend.
{Some stoics thought, like the hedonists, that happiness is the best thing, but unlike the hedonists, thought it was unattainable.

These are "belief structures" created during the Roman Empire (a point in time of a society). The privileged Romans looting makes hedonism possible. The falling empire needed a different belief structure, making stoicism desirable.

So it switched from good times, hedonism, to harder times, stoicism. Stoics just had to face the problems.

Stoics believed all pleasures have an opposing effect, not just some.

Thus, cannot reach happiness, it's constantly fleeting, like chasing a shadow.
}
{The two leaders of stoicism were a king and a slave, which makes it more egalitarian, as everyone has problems that must be faced.}
{Gibbons argued that Christianity spread by sword not word.}
Ecclesiastics, very stoic, all is vanity.
{Christians come again during the fall of the empire, but this time their ideas seem better fitted alongside stoicism. Stoicism doesn't have answers. Christianity does: another world. So while justice and happiness doesn't exist in the current circumstances, it will be given in the next world. The Ecclesiastics is stoic, depicts a mundane world, but ends differently, with the Messiah.}
{**These movements of thinking, over vast periods of time, represent very few people. Only the elite were able to record their writings. Marx had that right, that the history of ideas were the ideas of the dominating class. Slaves didn't have leisure time, and women were pushing out many babies, and taking care of them.**
  - good critical theory by Rick}
{**Rick still sets out to seek the best way to live, and sees what philosophers have to say about human conduct.**}
{Dark ages. **Rick likes St. Augustine's writings.** He also likes Anslem's argument for "Does God exist"? Christian views at the center. Actions had meanings in the overall cosmos structure. Including in Moby Dick, where a characters cares about why a whale doesn't like him: because everything has meaning.}
Max Weber: {**Quantitative over qualitative.} A world where rules are followed. {Procedural rationality.} It's the principle. A disenchanted world. {Further reading, Kafka, to see the silliness of beauracracy. Example, traffic court. This is Weber's view of the dark ages. People just acted upon the rules of society, without questioning it, obeying it, much of which, was through Christianity.
  - this reminds me of America, and, perhaps, Japan. The opposite of Taiwan, where the police questions your conduct, but doesn't fine you. Instead, perhaps, it may look bad to your family or school. The police are parents. Punishment of cash doesn't matter.**}
Someone else: although medival times were seen bad, it allowed leeway.
{Anslem's argument for the existence of God. A person who believes in God vs a person who doesn't believes in God. Those that don't care, are not affected. 1. God is a being of greater which cannot be conceived. 2. It is greater to exist in mind and reality, then in the mind alone.
  - hmmmm.}

{**out of place: Rick reminds us that this is Western philosophy. This is limited to the West.
  - and that's what's so bothersome. That of the infinite other societies we could be talking about, of the infinite cultures and their ideas, this is limited to the elite West at different points in time. It doesn't show how slaves thought how humans should behave, or women, or others excluded, but also, the rest of the world: including all of the tiny cultures within society, perhaps in a house, or public space, or on the streets, or in another country.**}

3. Kant and the path to Enlightenment
The western canon being canonized couldn't be accidental. {He says this as to justify why he skips 2000 years of the Medieval period.}

{Skips to modernity. As opposed to traditional societies (feudalism). **More problems** come about, to philosophize about. **Mix two things, Weber's ever so more rational society with Marx's commodification, you get a better understanding of modernity**, of **how lives are shaped**.}
 
Concept of individual is a historical one.* {**A serf felt his life actually meant something, in the struggle against the devil, etc. We don't think this way, and can only vicariously get this through a Christian themed film.**}

{Ethics shifts from virtue ethics, forming good people in good societies, to making the right decision / action.} Ethics become more narrow, quantitative. What action is correct?

Tries to make up for a deficit, that social bonds are not as important as procedural relations or economic relations, which becomes a structuring part of society.
{**Individuals have become fragmented. Primal social bonds have been uprooted by procedural laws and states.
  - another good thing about Taiwan. It's the social bonds that matter, not the procedures.**}

{**In traditional societies, the authority was what mom and dad said, which the church probably told them. The French Revolution broke this, and afterwards, it was the autonomous individual which had the authority.**}
 
 Kant:
 **What is Enlightenment?**
 **The motto: Dare to use your own reason.** {All decisions are for you to make, not mom, dad, or the church. **Autonomy becomes central to ethical decision-making.**}
 
{Presupposition: }There is a moral law. {There's a right or wrong.}

{Critique, criticism.}
 
The grounding for the metaphysics of moral (deontology):
Good will is good, you don't need to qualify it. A good will does the right thing because it your duty. No other reason.
{Will. Good will. Doesn't need qualifications. **A good acts for the sake of duty alone.** In Spike Lee's terms, You **do it because it's the right thing.**}
 
Good that that gets a kick out of it doesn't really count. It should have some suffering.

{Duty is when one acts out of reverence for moral law. That's where it goes into a circle.
  - then I zoned off a bit.}
 
Categorical Imperative:
Always act so that you can will the rule of action to be a universal law.
{Basically condenses the 10 commandments and includes the golden rule. It's imperative because it's a command. It's categorical, because it's not hypothetical. No ifs.}
 
Meaning, for every action you should be able to write a rule.

1. Universal
2. Reversible, the golden rule

Four Principles:
Ends principle:
**Always treat others as though an end, and never a way of means.** {Or, in Rick's layman: "**Don't use people.**" **This is why he said it makes creating an efficient economy impossible. Because it uses people. Can't hire an assistant manager at McDonald's. It uses a person. Treats people instrumentally.**}

Principle of freedom (professor believes in this):*
**We must always act under the practical postulate that our will is free.**

Basically, you are free. You can save the world. There are physchological and social factors {that may hinder or determine some of your actions}, but you are free. {Even in prison. Act as if you are free. Which is probably why many people write such good books there.} Politics usually forgets this, {making it seem hopeless, as if people are automatons determined by cosmos / physics of the world.}

Everyone has this. Hardly anyone goes through the day like an automaton. Except slaves? You're free! Act that way!

The principle of autonomy (professor also believes this):
**Always act so that you can regard your own will as making universal law.**

Act autonomously, follow your heart. You are willing that everyone else is willing to do what you did. {It only counts if you autonomously, created what to act upon, then decide upon an action. If God gives you a commandment, it doesn't count, whether you obey it or not. You have to think about what to act upon.
  - It kind of inquires the Ends Principle, creating a step before it.}

Dignity:
{**The human capacity to be moral**, according to last few principles.}

**Each person has an unconditional worth / value.**
{stopped here.}

A kingdom of ends:
**Everyone regards others as ends.**

The last goal is to reach this. Perpetual Peace.

Utilitarianism:
John Stuart Mill and Bentham:

Social hedonism.

Greater happiness principle:
Always act to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number.

Simple minded.

Calculating decisions everyday is utilitarian.

These moral theories still suck:

Kant's problem:
Content doesn't matter, no specificity. Too universal.

Utilitarianism problem:
Blessed isle vs electric chair example. Sending a smarter kid to college. Too content specific, not as universal.

More useful in economy, practical things.


4. Mill on Liberty

Shoot 3 vs 1000 example:
Kant:
Can't shoot.[?]
Utilitarianism:
Shoot 3.

Unable to club a human. Theories are abstract. Real situations are more complex.

On Liberty:
Harm principle:
the government only intervenes if citizens are genuinely harmed, not an offense like waving a nazi flag

A self-regarding action should not be interfere.

Against:
Simply giving money to the poor would follow this rule. But do the poor people know how to use that money?

* Harm to others.
* Harm to self.
* If our freedom interferes with our freedoms?

Truth is not majority, but because they are true. Not a vote or belief.

Limitation:
Negative freedom only. Freedom from constraint, but not about freedom to constrain.

Referencing Marx economics:
Need to be enabled to freedom. Rights are no good without being enabled.

If you have the right to eat, you still need to be able to eat. Need some enabling condition.

Volunteer:
mcdonalds, jail, army, are all voluntary.

Give them their needs.

Hegel:
Historical, freedom is to overcome obstacles, a more historical process.

Transition to struggle to overcome obstacles in next lectures.

Marx:
Point isn't to philosophize, but to use it to take action and shape the world.

5. Hagel and Modern Life
Less radical side of Hagel.

History ends because media reaches everywhere.

Marx economics:
Problem with capitalist economy.

Contradictions don't matter, just twinge. Politicians lie, it's taken less serious.*

Reduce needs, and understand it. All basic needs are marketable. Food, love, etc.

Problems with capitalism:
Classes exist. Competition, work being free labor is a joke. But the people on the streets do not choose not to work. An simple empirical way to check if there are classes: don't work for 8 years, and if bad things happen to you, then you are in the working class.

Positive effect of capitalism:
Science. There is no way to reach the level of current production of technology. It adds needs, CD players vs tapes example.*

Technology exists to solve many problems, but won't be persued because of economic imperatives. Electric cars, NASA ball bearings, etc. Its not a conspiracy that the senate is full of millionaires.

Moral dilemma of circumstance. People are poor. 

Straying from Marx:
How to accept poor under bridges and beautiful buildings?

At some level we must believe that it was their choice to be there.*

In politics this is clear, in society this is very difficult to accept.

There are human requirements.

To the extent that this, in modern society still exists is despicable, and a shame compared to past civilizations.*

Life should never have poverty.

Life needs freedom, free from constraints. Not just reduced to work. Not just a hobby.

Life is too distracted, business. An example with Alexander the Great who saw a philospher on the streets and said of he wasn't Alexander, he would want to be that guy. Not messing with bills.

Back to Marx:
Human requirements. Food, shelter, health.

Everything is based on work. People ask what your job is. (as opposed to asking your favorite things to do). Housewives, old people are not valued because it is not waged. How can Donald Trump opening a hotel be worth more than an old man telling you something that may make you think about human meaning? That kind of society is pathological.*

6. Nietzsche. Knowledge and Ethics
The past ethical theories all have utopian moments, despite their flaws.

Ethics and politics are related.

Aristotle wrote the constitution for ethics last.

Marx had an obvious flaw, so do liberals. [todo: did not comprehend]

Commodities became ever so diverse so to the point that one can't simply stroll a park, instead stroll a mall*, a modern beauracracy, like Brazil, with a bunch of departments. Don't read Weber, read Kafka, before the law and the trial.

Professor now goes toward human values, toward critics.

People don't worry about Marx anymore, they worry about Neitzche.

Knowledge is power.

The professor knows how to pass knowledge. Grades are up to the professor. He has power to pass beliefs.*

Neitzche Geneology of morals:
Good, bad, right, wrong.

Greeks virtue was based on being well-rounded, not good or bad. A clever liar is virtuous.

Action based on resentment, more Christian-like.

Do something you want, feel guilty. Do something else, feel helpless.

Another core principle of Neitzche, that made him seem scandalous: good is relative. Different period of times had different definitions of good.

It isn't that, but the condition of the possibility to do good is different.

Compassion and love behind Christianity. And beneath compassion and love is resentment and hatred.

Example, a love and hatred for homosexuals.

There are duplicitous in morals.

America has more people in prisons than any country per capita except South Africa. People are sent in not because they did something bad, but because people fear them doing harm in society, harm being a duplicity, they actually might have been doing something good ［assassinate Bush, kill a pimp].*

Example of Neitzhche:

Kuwait example. [war for oil, imperialism]

Our polyponessian war, confuse our values, Vietnam War, use massive force to quickly kill guilt and fear. Systems of power connected to systems of value tend to spread and become total.*

Christianity speaks of love, and it is a huge part of American politics.

Today, it religions and beliefs are idiosyncratic. It doesn't bother people. An example, a roommate prays, it's annoying.

Recap from next lecture:
1. Religion is resentment, under a cloak of love.
2. Must be suspicious of everything. 

"God is dead."

Professor thinks Neitzche just meant a sociological context, that society changed, life is based around work now, and only Sunday is left for religion.


7. Kierkegaard and the Contemporary Spirit:
Labor division, blah blah blah.

Kierkegaard:
Most sophisticated defender of Christianity.

In a place where all are Christians, all are non-Christians. It isn't being Moses anymore, just a status quo, something you do on Sunday.*

What are human subjects?
Kierkegaard's The Sickness unto Death:

Rugged individualism leads to ragged individuals.

Why psychology is impossible (why psychologists can't help people). Psyche has a problem.

Despair:
Despairing relation is the self.

Definitions of despair.
No conscience, no self.

Despair that is unaware of being in despair, is hopeless.
Despair with a crisis, is a sickness.

Sick unto death: Unable to die, yet no hope for life, when we learn greater danger, one hopes for death, then despair is the hopelessness of not being able to die. A fun paradox.*

Social examples from the professor:
In horror movies, the hope is to survive. In apocalypse films, Blade Runner the greatest hope is to die, but can't. Mad Max is exciting, not because it's scary, but because they want to die.

The problem isn't the non-believer, it's the problem of a non-person. Are there people? Raised in televised culture, what's real?

Struggling to be sane in insane conditions.

Valium and drugs takes away fear.

19th century: Replacement of manual labor by machine labor. 20th century: Replacement of thinking and feeling by machine labor. What is left of humans?

It's better to be an image than a person. Ronald Reagan is an image, an icon. So his image transcends his reality, "larger than life". It didn't matter who he really is, just a puppet.i

In a society where image counts to that extent, hyper socialization, the subject disappears, the human.*

Humans seem useless, in terms of labor surely.

Computers do the boring manual labor. Leaves freedom for projects.

Culture. Post-modern culture. References based on images. Culture is important because that's ehat creates our identity, learn languages. In a commodity world, it becomes difficult to differentiate one developed fashion or developed as a person. If one is driven to find meaning in images, then that is sickness unto death.

It's not human values anymore, it's human commodities. Turn values into images, marketing, products.

There could be a revolution in China, shown on TV tw minutes later, forgot about it in a month, then put people on a show three months.*

That type of society creates a different kind of people.* The question is that whether we should call them that or not. At a certain point, the professor doesn't. People without affect. An automaton.

from the wiki of post-modernism:
Noam Chomsky argued that post-modernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or emperical knowledge.

I think it does add something; it adds the individual's experience of something, and from experience, whether from media or life, is real and can gain analytical or empirical knowledge, at even a faster rate.

8. Philosophy and post-modern culture
Recap:
Retrace human values through western philosophy. First there were virtue theories, then Hagel said to look at historical view to figure out what's needed, then economic (Marx, economic motivations of which people were culturally unaware, Weber on the state) and social examples (Neitzche, frame problems in terms of state, unaware of the location of power. Kierkegaard on culture) were given, then culture.

Culture, especially post-modern culture destroys people.

Even with freedom, it is pointless to talk about humans in the absence in humans.

Freud:
Civilization and it's Disconents:
Conscience mind, is a small part of the mind. Focus on unconscience. Goal is to make the it (eid, unconscience) the I (Ego, conscience), enlightenment. The goal of modern culture, is to reverse the process.*

Not all [action] is psychological, able to be healed by a therapist. Goal of psychoanalyst: make the eid the I.

Professor's examples:
Goal is to talk it out, reflect, think.

Pleasure principle of mass culture:
The lack of effect, especially harmful media. It's just not conscience, because it's media, it's not real, although in reality, it exists.

Of the tons of information around, the goal of mass culture is to fit the narratives in those media.

Total Recall? Lol. Takes place in the conscience mind, yet culture runs everything. Vacations are a pain, why not just consume some memories. It's a good product. 

To the professor, it's buzzare that people find more things in common with a person in a period dramsa then the people next to them.

Unsure what's cultured or not.

For example, in a cafe, a The Doors song comes up, and one doesn't even listen [because it's culturally expected?].

Thinking vs reacting* [harks talk with French guy at Dulan]

Tune out is one way. Meaning, ignoring things made by people and going toward nature. But where's nature now?* For example: someone said the Swiss food at Busch Gardens is better than real Swiss food.

Every human need can be accessed digitally now, except to destroy itself.

People feel disconnected without media.*

Perhaps a cynical outlook, but quite true.

Some other book by Freud:
Love and death, or forgetfulness.

In other countries, which will receive American media, naiively. Replacing a crude totalitarianism with a subtle totalitarianism, which is much harder to storm.*

Professor hopes for people, need to re-inject resistance, or at less simulate it, but believes already democracy died.

People are disinterested. What revolution could save people?

Resgan and Bush, destroying the world while no one cares, and those that do are not being listened to, just in a daze.

To read: Paul's argument, answers to the Corinthians. If hope goes, everything else will go with it. Not a fun apocalypse, but everything human too. 

Dialectical philosophy faces death. Don't forget this is a barbaric moment, ...where folks want to nuke, and why not?
