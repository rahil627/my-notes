Neitzche:

Plato:

See emotions as mysterious, exotic, dangerous, profound, valuable.

The greek apatea, perfectly rational, but emotionless, which the professor characterized zombie-like.

The Stranger by Albert Camus:
a character without emotions, and when prosecuted, found inhuman.

Mr Spock, or Data.

Existentialists (the professors favorite):
Soren Kierkegaard:
It’s about passion inwardness, not belief

Neitzche:
Good life is passion. Have passion with style, that serves life.

philosophers: Aristotle, Neitzche, William James, Sigmeund Freud, Jon Sartr, phenomenology* (study of experience).

physchologists. And how they relate.

How are emotions intelligent? A way with dealing with the world. An effective way of dealing with the world…The way we engage with the world

What is an emotion?
physiology, feeling, behavior?
