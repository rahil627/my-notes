# 2. The Advent of Freedom in the Modern World
Foundation of 17th and 18th century Europe

Locke
  - English revolution
  - influenced American government-inception in Jefferson 
  - external freedom
Rousseau
  - prophet of French Revolution
  - internal freedom

Recap two freedoms: outer, control over environment without being dominated, inner, control over fear, illusion, anxiety, etc.

Treatise on Two Governments:
Chapter two, state of nature:
Begin in nature, a kind of mythical utopia, civil. Out of some social need / conflicts, begin government.

Chapter 4:
Two forms of liberty (freedom), natural liberty of man that existed before government, and the liberty of man in society (civil liberty).

The liberty of man in the state of nature is only ruled by nature, otherwise he is completely free. The liberty of man in society is to be under legislative power established by consent or contact.

Freedom from power is necessary...cannot enslave himself by contract or power of another.

The end of law isn't to restrain, but to enlarge freedom. Where there is no law, there is no freedom. (Liberty to freedoms)

...

Begin in state of nature. People come together to cooperate in peace. A community is formed. A governance is formed, people make decisions together. To ensure property.

Property usually means assets, but it could be the person himself, or perhaps, a slave person.




# 1. Freedom in the Ancient World

## Intro

About the idea of freedom.

Inspired many for thousands of years, throughout vast cultures.

Ideas have value, count in what people feel or are defined.

A cultural life: A life pursued of certain values.

For America: justice, laws, civil rights, constitutionalism, democracy, etc.

People escaped their countries for freedom, from governments that deprived them, for freedom.

Ideas matter, and none matters more than freedom.

## Personal story
Kennedy's 1961 inaugural speech in mainly about freedom (and liberty).

The professors confesses he stupidly thought freedom was something exclusive of America and was for the frontier of freedom.

## Ancient

### Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads
Swaraj - Rule of one's self (and control of one's country). Freedom in dual sense: external and internal. Political: control of one's own territory. Spiritual: rule of one's own soul.

Act without staving. Finds peace / harmony. Free from delusion. Spiritual liberation.

One is free when one sees oneself in all others. Meaning, one doesn't alienate one's self from others, which could turn into fear. Unity.

Snake story, like Indiana Jones grabbing an object.

Fear is one of the greatest threats.

### Ancient Greece
Political / external: Thucydides...?

[note: took break here]

Plato:
Affected by Pelopolessian War and Socrate's death.

Ship metaphor: a ship is steered by a master: an idiot, and the crew are equally stupid but also tend to fight and cheat in order to navigate the ship according to their desires. In order to properly navigate the ship, the people need real knowledge and experience of navigating. None of them do. Eventually, the crew will try to either entirely manipulate or take over the master, and the ship will hit a rock.

The master is the sovereign people, the crew politicians, and the missing unknown, the philosopher, may or may not be on the ship.

The actual (democratic) state is like this. The ideal state has a philosopher as the navigator, since he does have the knowledge and experience.

The lesson: The majority is stupid and will always make bad consensual decisions.

Plato advocates a meritocracy.
  - but how to properly educate, when the educational institutions are itself corrupted? (thinking about Taiwan)

Plato (and Glycon) on just and unjust state and soul:
Living under a despot is slavery. Living under a state is also slavery for most people, and kings for a few.

Under a despot and state, how is the soul, free or enslaved?
[todo: listen again]

Mentions Christ, "the truth will set you free", and Augustine.

More again about the two freedoms: lower and higher. Lower, free from passion, fear, etc. Higher, free to do whatever politically, externally: property, capital, etc.
