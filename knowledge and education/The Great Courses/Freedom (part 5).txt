# Freedom 5 Emma Goldman and the Anarchist Idea of Freedom

The first four in the lecture were theorists.

These next four are practical, impatient, fighters. All are non-white.

**19th century, three distinct philosophies of freedom:
1. Hagel, nationalism, state as revolutionary change
2. Mill, liberalism, defense of civil liberties (and rights) of individuals against state and ?
3. Goldman, anarchism, totally opposed to any form of state authority, opposed liberalism because they just don't go far enough, trust laws too much. They reject any form of government. They demand a revolution (violent or non-violent). Resistance to authority. Deprives us of free thought and expression.**

Living My Life, Emma's auto-biography

Unwanted, marred, maimed as a child. At one point, when her father beat and told she was undesired, then beat her sister who was protecting her, she completely stopped caring for her father, and only answered when asked, mechanically.

Find her outlet in ensuring children grow up well by being a midwife, wanting to whisper into newborn children's' ears, "rebel!"

Age 18, attended a political speech by anarchist Joanna Grea. The Hay Market riot. Anarchists hanged for their ideals.

Moved to Greenwich Village (the heart of Anarchism). Joined other anarchists to promote better working conditions for women seamstresses. Became an inspiring orator. 1893 imprisoned o√≠r a speech to incite the unemployed of NYC to riot. 1901 imprisoned for radical politics. 1917 imprisoned for opposing American involvement in World War I.

Delighted in heresy.

The more opposition I encountered, the more I felt in my element.

Orate theory of anarchism and practice of rebellion.

There are many kinds of anarchists, but there are principles:
1. Human nature is benevolent, not aggressive. Competition and aggression is socialized. Humans are plastic. Her optimism comes from stems from this. She believes humans can learn to be more cooperative, caring, sharing toward / with others. She insisted it depended on early child upbringing.
  - but then, isn't benevolence socialized?

Can human nature be changed?

Human nature caged today, in such a narrow space, whipped daily into submission, how can we speak of its potential? But let it be free. Freedom can teach us the dynamic forces of human nature, and all of its wonderful potentialities.

2. Freedom
Our true liberation, individual and collective, from authority...the same can be said of all power (religion, democracy, or absolute)...

True freedom is not negative (license), but positive: The liberty to actually do something, the **power** to do it.

**Disobedience to any form of coercion, rebellion and revolution, must be our attempt to achieve it.**

Again, three definitions
1. Hagel, truth, consciousness of God's plan or communism (Marx), state is the agent of God
2. Mill, the individuals ability to act and think freely, and only unjustified if it harms another person
3. Goldman, consists of liberty *and* the power to get true equality. Human liberation, women, color, and all.

Mother Earth, Emma's journal.

I may be arrested, maybe

I will not be silent. I will never acquiesce or submit to male authority, nor will I make peace to a system that degrades women to a mere incubator, and which fattens on our innocent victims,

I here

I will not

She always preferred defiance, choosing jail over a $100 fine.

Deported to Soviet Union.

She thought she'd see some good ideas of Lenin, but she quickly became thoroughly disillusioned by Lenin's Revolution, fled to Europe.

She wrote, ...**The bolsheviks were ready to use any means to have a revolution (an end).** [todo: get more]

An importance to relation of means and ends.

Marx, "any means that leads to the communism, suits me to be revolutionary".

Emma feels this corrupts the idea of communism.

**All human experience teaches that means cannot be separated from the ultimate end, the means employed become through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose. They influence it, they modify it. The means and ends become virtually identical...** [todo: get the rest]





# Freedom 2 cont.

Philosophy, a constellation of concepts, a system.

## John Locke:
**Liberty of man in nature - free from any superior power on earth...to have only the law of nature for his rule.**

**Liberty of man in society - liberty under the legislative power (of man, / authority) established by consent or contract, not under will or law...among individuals according to the trust to legislative.**
  - legislative is representative / oligarchy

And so this freedom from absolute, arbitrary power is so necessary, so closely joined with a man's preservation that he cannot part with this liberty, but by with what forfeits his preservation life itself, for a man by contract or with his own consent cannot enslave himself to anyone, nor put himself in the absolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life when he pleases.

**The end of law is therefore not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For where there is no law there cannot be freedom. For liberty is to be free from restraint and violence from others and therein not subject to the arbitrary will of another, but to freely follow his own.**

Freedom under contract in law: English liberalism.

Sanctifies government by law / legislative, as opposed to monarchy / executive.
  - so, progress? From monarchy to oligarchy. Doesn't feel like it.

Contract. We have all freely entered into a contract.
  - by being born into a society with such a government, one doesn't freely enter. One is simply born there.

The idea / hope is that one wouldn't create laws to enslave themselves.
  - **but when a society becomes so large (in population), corruption begins, and then the top doesn't have to abide laws; Money rules.**

Ahhhh hah. Heres the problem.

Locke continues: men being, by nature, free and independent. No one can be out of this state and subject to the political power of another without a contract, without his own consent.
  - **the problem is that Locke assumes people are born in nature, as opposed to a society, which is where most people are born.**


...continued listening the next day

...The great instrument and means of that, being the laws of that society, the first and fundamental law of the commonwealth is the establishment of the legislative power.

Why? Because these people have an interest, to preserve stability of the middle-class (and their property, and belongings).

What is freedom? Freedom is having liberty from absolute, arbitrary power, and we can trust Parliament (English's legislative power).

Was not envisaged in the ancient world. Freedom from absolute power, yes. But not **freedom through law, a contract among individuals (who have property) with vested interests.**

**In the state of nature, we do enjoy an unrestrained state of liberty.**

Because we want to settle disputes peacefully, we devise a government. This government ensures rights, right to ensure property, ensures freedom, freedom under law from an absolute government. This gives us political freedom. It also ensures religious liberty.

## Rousseau
(todo: re-listen, this is from memory)
Social Contract (book)

Liberty (freedom) and equality.

Locke allows inequality, knowing some people will desire capital more than others.

Rousseau wants **property shared**.

...Everywhere man is in chains...

Sees slavery and domination everywhere.

Equality must be a part of governance.
