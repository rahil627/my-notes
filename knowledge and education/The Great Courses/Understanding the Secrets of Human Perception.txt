Understanding the Secrets of Human Perception:
Overall very boring, obvious observations. Textbook like. Very lab, scientific. Removed.


13. Perception in Action
Our perception doesn't really have value unless we do something with them, to take action. Our sensory system is particularly adapted for it.

Not just judgement based experiment.

We aren't always consciously aware of our decisions.

J.J. Gibson
Ecological psychology.

Study environment instead of people in labs. Identify the information. Direct perception.

Meh, the rest just repeats. Labs suck, unconscious decisions, direct action based on perception, examples: frog eating fly, outfielder catching ball.

Later had another specific example, but meh, no new info.

14. Attention and Perception
Inference. Example: motion.

Inattention blindness. Example: using hands-free phone while driving.

Really obvious and boring.

15. Kinesthetic Perception
Vestibular perception.
Propi perception.

Meh, boring.

16. Seeing, Remembering, Inferring
Perceptual development part 1.

How infants see things.

Video of infants as great tool to study infant perception*
  - reminds me of using history and documentary video of studying people

17. How Infants sense and act on the world
Meh.

?. Sending the thoughts of others.
Experiments using the first thing that comes to people's mind.

Very shallow. Lame.
