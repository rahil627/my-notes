# 1. What is Big History?

## Professor intro:
Christian, the professor, has a mixed background, lived in several countries, says may explain why he has a mixed background for studies.

He taught at a university in Sydney for 25 years, teaching Russian history.

Read Dostkoevsky, Tolstoy, felt it was completely different from England, in Oxford.

Cuban Missle Crisis, a friend said he was grateful of him, made him realize that civilization could end. He also wondered if kids on that side thought the same. [passion to action]

At the university tried to teach them how Russians live. [but he himself only lived there briefly. How can one teach for 25 years?]

## What is big history?:
Influenced by French annals school. See history by geological and ecological context, the change in material things. Broydell said if one views history on a different scale, one views it differently. View it on the large scale. To get a rounded history of the past, one needs to see it on multiple scales. For example, vodka played a huge role in Russia.

References Rise of the West in 1963.

His book: Maps of Time.

**The goal is for people to be able to have bearings, know their spot in the map of space and time.**

St. Augustine did the same. H.G. Wells is perhaps the most famous attempt of the 21st century. Wells wanted to united human history and smaller histories. Back then carbon dating did not exist.

Also a problem of specialization, and lack of transdisciplinary subjects. He feels schools fragment history by separating subjects. And feels it's unsatisfying. A physicist, Shrodinger saw this, felt only the universal knowledge gets full credit, impossible for a single mind to do it.

Christians says this is just one attempt, and expects biologist's versions, geologic versions, etc. He is a historian.

## Roadmap:
Origin of universe, earth, biosphere, society.
Avoid science and math.

Like Eric Schason's astronomer's version of big history. Central theme is the increasingly complex themes of the universe. 8 of them. Have emergent properties.

## The 8 thresholds:
Creation of universe
Creation of stars
Creation inside dying stars of chemicals*
Creation of our Earth, and solar systems
Creation of life and the evolution of it
Creation of our Homo sapiens
**Emergence of agricultural society**
**Modern revolution**

Future
Overview

Hope to think deeply about the larger scheme of things, and seriously. Hope to have a clear understanding and why it's important. Hope to have a underlying sense of unity of modern knowledge.

# 2. Moving across scales

Just trying to sway the audience to understand the scales, human, earth, and cosmos. It's not very good at this because the medium of dialog is not good at conveying scale. Lots of pathos junk. No facts.

**Gestalts switch.**

But good to think about how humans gained knowledge of the moon and space only after we, the world, gained images of it through science or experience.

I think Cosmos would do a way better job to teach this stuff.

3. ?
Stopped here.

[I remember the whole thing just being very simple, over-dramatic with the scaling device, better off with a BBC television film, or simply, one of those large world histories he mentioned before.

Also, because the non-human portion just doesn't interest me much. I care for humans, not stars.]

To big history:



# 24. Threshold 7: Agriculture
Agriculture attracts people like gravity. Migrant communities stop at agricultural communities. **Technology enabled agriculture.** | **Densely populated areas are socially complex.**

By increasing control of food.

Early Agrarian era - First time in history where Agrarian societies appeared: more than 10,000 years ago.

Second Agrarian era - First big city, 5000 years ago.

**Evolved independently in 6 different areas (across 3 different 'world zones'), with little to no connection.**

BP - before present (1950), when carbon-14 dating was introduced.

11,000bp, Fertile Crescent, first evidence.
9,000bp, Papua New Guinea, taro, root crop, sugar cane, banana. No other part of Australasian 'world zone'.
  - **much like 蘭嶼!**
9,000bp, East Asia, China, probably parts of India too (Indus Valley)
4-5000bp, sub-Saharan Africa, maybe Sahara too
4-5000bp, MesoAmerica (México, Andes región)
2-4000bp, North America

**Humans and domesticated plants and animals are in a symbiotic relationship.**
  - kinda profound thought to me.

**115/120,000,000 tons of biomass is domesticated.**

# 27 Power and it's Origins
Much of history was written with power in it's center: political histories. Partly because states kept records of it. Even much of literature such as Epic of Gilgamesh, the epics of Homer, and old Chinese records, and so on.

**Power existed in the Paleolithic, but much of the power was mostly personal and/or familial. Not sustained by large institutional structures.**

When (and how) did institutionalized power emerge?

mini-threshold?

**Spread of agricultural societies and institutionalized power correlate in time and space.**
  - **control food, control people?**

What is power?

Marvin Harris: ~For the first time, there appeared on earth, kings, police, jailers, along with palaces, jails, and concentration camps. This is when people began to grovel and work. The rise of the state was the rise of slavery.**
  - [todo: get exact quote]
  - perhaps with the control of food, people began over-working for their superior power-abusers, accumulating capital for them.




# 29. From Villages to Cities
Before this lecture, mostly scientific, general conclusions mostly agreed by scientific community [little evidence]. **Now, written history begins, and with it, information explodes.**

**Took 9 peasants to support one civilian.**

Mini-thresholds:
**secondary product revolution** (milk, plow, wool, etc.)
**irrigation.**
