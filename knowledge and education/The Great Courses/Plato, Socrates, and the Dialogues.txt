Domain:
[The professor is mostly excited about the influence The Dialogues (and The Republic) has made on him. He mostly just states how much value he gained, almost as if he were enlightened, learning how to learn, as it were the Bible of self-education, over-excited, zealous even.]

Plato teaches how to read. Socrates teaches how to talk.

[... I guess I just didn't find the content enlightening, but that may be premature judgement ad that was just the first two or three lectures.]

Still, Plato is material I can read myself, and then use Wikipedia for assistance.



# 16. Living Voice [Socrates]
Who is Socrates?
**Who are you? (Purpose in society?)**
Universal hero
Ideal lover
Endemonia of love
Hero of knowledge
Hero of humor, a divine comedy
Witty, humorous
**Only laughs once**
[morally serious, yet humorous]
Tragic hero
Socratic irony
**Melancholy, yet humorous**
  - pushed to the extreme; cannot find anything satisfying, looking for something higher; better, not satisfied by wealth, pleasure, power, reward; compares a perfect world to reality; he longs for something; ironic mask; [can't just be a complete asshole;]
**Shouldn't take anything too seriously, not people, nor wisdom**, nothing. Nothing is that important, pursue own knowledge, don't worry for long.
**Playful and serious**
**Persistent human problems**
Like many spiritual figures, Socrates never wrote a book. It is only in reality can one gain understanding. Language is not enough to communicate it all.
**The point is to communicate socially, with others, the living voice.
Both Socrates and Plato don't believe in the written word.**
  - loss of information in human language, loss of context and mind
You learn by enquiring others, the examined life, think.



# 3. Examined Life
"The un-examined life is not worth living"

Theatetus, Tameus

## Tameus
Theory of nature, written after The Republic, last one?, a bit sloppy, uncared for, thrown together.

The professor claims he wrote it merely for justification for older ideas. He uses teleology to show that there is a purpose (/ meaning / reason by God) to have moral and political order.

Plato, as usual, avoids the external world, for the purpose of highlighting ideas, moral and political.

## Theatetus
Socrates: Who are we? What do we know? How do we know it?

Theateus: Knowledge is sense perception.

(Heraclitus: flux, everything is constantly changing, incoherent.

Protagoras: knowledge is relative. Man is the measure of all things. Solipsism.

**Knowledge and language are impossible under Protagoras.**

**Nothing is known in Heraclitus's world.**
  - **these two maybe the closest to reality, like eastern philosophers, jokingly but meaningfully saying, look at reality. Accept that reality cannot be communicated into an artificial language; just accept reality as a whole: holism.**

Digression continue.)

Discussion of the nature of knowledge leads to an impasse.

[skipped two guesses by Theatetus]

Theatetus: Knowledge is true judgement (justified belief) and a logos
Socrates: leads to infinite regress

Wittgenstein and Russell reference this bit for logic.

Works hard, doesn't get anywhere, but still learns, even though no conclusion to this question.

**During the end, Socrates must go to court, and is soon to be accused and put to death, abruptly stopping his / the inquiry into the nature of knowledge.**


# 15. The Platonic Achievement [Plato]
Plato desires an ideal city, uses characteristics and longing for past river civilizations (Egypt, Mesopotamia, India) such as a mythical, constant, static, stability, ideal, perfection (to him) of the soul and city. His work represents the last of that ancient river civilization religions.

**Those past civilizations had a religion, some kind of culture which resulted in solidarity.** Greek religion (Homeric gods) fell apart during his time, challenges to it rose, such as Ionian physics, so the mind became aware of and created more possibilities, resulting in a flourishing time.

He replaces the Greek religion with the forms of good, form of bravery over Aries, and the sun (like past civs).

**Autonomous rationality.**

**Constantly tries to create a harmony for the soul and the city. His answers change throughout his life, but his subject is the same: ethics and politics.**

When plato says poetry, he means any artificially constructed thing. He desires to censor poets (artists) that aren't educative; He feels other art work corrupts people.

**He provides a foundation (and outline) for knowledge.**

**All art is moral, educational. - Tolstoy**

**Ethics over poetics.
 - content over aesthetics.**

**Homer shows the physical world of bodies. Plato supersedes (according to the professor) by showing the soul and forms of good.
  - but by doing so, Plato only shows his view / ideas, as opposed to reality. Homer's work contains a state of mind and history. Plato's work contains no source events, which is how the mind learns: by deriving ideas from reality. No learning comes from simply ideas. One must read the historians, essayists, and whatever sources one finds of that time and space, and put it together. Unlike Aristotle, who is deeply in reality, comparing real things, Plato is simpler, pointing toward simple ideals, as opposed to the infinite reality.**

The Dialogues are the ideal of autonomous reasoning.

Hero of the creator, Plato, and the hero of the creation, Socrates. The choreographer and the dancer.



# 6. Soul and City
Being vs Seeming
Be vs Act

Socrates defines words, by creating meanings. Sophists don't define anything, and instead are ambiguous.

**Bad education leads to bad polis.**

**artificial laws vs natural laws**
- paper laws vs good culture

Glaucas and Adamontes:
People by nature are unjust

Seem just, but do unjust

**Show that justice is good in itself, as health is to the body. Show that a man being unjustly hurt, that being justful is the right thing to do.**
  - brings martyrs to mind - Socrates' death, MLK, etc.

**Socrates:
Let's look at the city instead of an individual.**

Build a minimum city, of utmost necessity. 5 people, each one with a different job. Will be just, but no leisure, simple life.

Disorder in the soul means disorder in the city.

Desires accumulate, Feverish city: doctors, political entity, a philosopher-king
.
Philosophical dogs. They love / know their own, antagonize others.
.
Once a city / society is correct, freeze it in time. Stop development.

People with good education will have good bodies and souls. An ideal guardian.

[this is becoming terrible]

Censorship poets, like Homer, which shows very violent, brutish peoples. Show the good parts.
  - like censoring bad video games, anti-liberal, like a parent or Japan's culture

Hierarchy society, immobile classes, not everyone has access to knowledge and reason, does not have an idea like 'open society'. He doesn't like democracy, because of the history of the Polypolyssian War. Only the tiny elite can make decisions for the rest.

Poetry censored by the guardians / elite.
  - much like Japan?

**Ascetic guardians / elite. Only subsistence wages. The workers get the surplus value.**

Adamontes says the elite won't be happy, they want luxury. Plato thinks of the city as a whole organism. The elite have to perform their function.

... blah

The ideal of Plato is summed up in the end of Chapter 5, the philosopher-king, that the fact that we can't have an ideal person, we can't have an ideal city.

[hmmmmm, the professor is too shallow, overly-excited, like a faux-philosopher. It's not only annoying, but I feel if I read The Republic, my awareness will bring out different ideas. So this lecture series doesn't seem too interesting.

Only listen to first few and last few lectures.]
