Conclusion:
Biographies are always interesting, and of artists, more relevant.

Painting is an old medium, but one can see the artist’s interests, and small innovations in art through them. The changes are very small.

Michelangelo saw this, and focused on sculpting.

Painters actually had to travel to Italy to experience real paintings. Cameras did not exist.

Caspar David Friedrich wasn’t interested in traveling to Italy, instead, preferred exploring nearby surroundings, using the beauty of nature.

Pablo Piccaso for having several styles, all modern.

Alexander Calder for circuses, mobiles, and large installations.

Marchel Duchamp detached art from objects.

Joseph Bueys (and more so, Fluxus) performed, and made art an experience.

Why are paintings separated from craft? What’s the difference between pottery and painting? Why are these painters canonized? I have no idea. I think crafts from the rest of the world are far more diverse. Only a few made large strides, and they weren’t painters.

Perhaps for the same reasons, games are not considered art. Neither is placemaking. Or a lot more experiences that I value.

I should check out a history of art. Or not.

It’s nice to see that at certain periods of time, a group of people who share progressive values, ignore that past, and in doing so, further art — Durer’s colleagues, the pre-Raphaelites, Fluxus. And sometimes singular people — Michelangelo, Duchamp. Perhaps it’s difficult to gain notice without a group of people shoving new art in people’s faces. As for the singular artists, they were all famous in traditional fine arts, then created something new.
