"In wildness is the preservation of the world." - Thoreau

# Preface:
"1. The current disconnect between kids and nature threatens the health of children...
2. The current trend toward denaturing childhood also threatens the places we live and perhaps even the future of humanity."

"If sustainability depends on transforming the human relationship with nature, the present-day gap between kids and nature emerges as one of the greatest and most overlooked crises of our time, threatening people and countless other species."

...

Exactly how do kids connect with nature, and how does this process change as they grow up...Ultimately, all this research has led me to a series of conclusions about how nature connection actually works, and how the process changes as children grow.

# Introduction
## Bootful of Pollywogs

"The major problems in the world are the trait of the difference between how nature works and the way people think." - Gregory Bateson

Scott grew up near a small forest with a "frog pond," and, a huge 2000 acre forest, "the woods".

"Vision is the least intimate of human senses." Perhaps a stab at modernity'a infatuation with screens. Then he describes how the woods filled the senses, including "water-drenched autumn air".
  - humidity is felt
  - the first point, is rough. Sight I think is the most influential, but I guess it's not intimate, not touching, no feeling.

"Often we avoided trails entirely, preferring to bushwhacked through the dense coastal foliage..."
  - they had real nature. I only had a few ditches and yards. I explored neighborhoods by bicycle. They explored 2000 acres.



In mid-teenage years played games they made up.

"In recent years I've come to realize that I can't help but take that Pacific Northwest with me wherever I go.

"And well-intentioned parents fearful of their children somehow falling behind or missing out have filled their schedules with sports, music lessons, academic tutoring, and other organized activities, with little time left for unstructured play."
  - hmmm, instead of finding an independent school to teach at, perhaps I should just find a **camp or daycare facility. Those are more playful places.**

最要害（重要）自己管理(/sustainable)的待解決是掌握(master, control)心裡，教育；不是科學跟科技。

我們有現在的失調（沒有用，無用）看法：我們住（exist）自然外面。。。1。我們的經濟是一分部自然。。。2。我們住在東西的海裡面。沒有家的感覺。沒有意願照顧（保護培育）自然。

自然怎麼變其他的(other)，大超市？。。。1。有的人說因為寫的語言來了，然後沒有口頭的語言，那跟地方有很緊的關係。2。有的人說我們的農場的級掌握。。。我們滿滿得(progressively)被自己疏遠(alienate, estrange).

Understanding informed by emotional engagement.

...for we will not fight to save what we do not love.

And the best time to initiate this love affair? Childhood.

Guided nature walks.

Near absence of adolescents...the magic of this verdant wood seems to have dissipated...the forest feels tame, lacking in spirit...I no longer sense the wildness that permeated my younger bones..."To walk a trail after bushwhacking is to dumb down."

Trail-free adventure playgrounds...nature is a contact sport, and nature can take it.

...nature is all around us...

...nature needs to be integral to their everyday lives, from place-based learning at school, to unstructured, unsupervised, even risk-prone play at home...

# 2. The Power of Place
Discovering nearby nature.

You can't know who you are until you know where you are.
