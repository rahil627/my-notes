intro:
four books: The Great Learning, Doctine of the Mean, Analects of Confucius, Mencius

content:
Book I, Part A
1. What is the point of mentioning the word 'profit'?...All that matters is that there should be benevolence and rightness. What is the point of meantioning the word 'profit'?

2. It was by sharing their enjoyments with the people that men of antiquity were able to enjoy themselves.
  - sharing

3. If you can see that, you will not expect your own state to be more populous than the neighboring states.
  - natural order

Exercise due care over the education provided by the village schools, and discipline the people by teaching them the duties proper to sons and younger brothers...

When those who are seventy wear silk and eat meat and the masses are neither cold nor hungry, it is impossible for their prince not to be a true King.
  - ideal society to Mencius, equality, treat elderly well

Now when food meant for human beings is so plentiful as to be thrown to dogs and pigs, you fail to realize that it is time for garnering, and when men drop dead from starvation by the wayside, you fail to realize that it is time for distribution.
  - equality in basic human needs

5. A territory of a hundred li square is sufficient to enable its ruler to become a true King. If You Majesty practices benevolent government towards the people, reduces punishment and taxation, gets the people to plough deeply and weed promptly, and the able-bodied men learn, in their spare time, to be good sons and good younger brothers, loyal to their prince and true to their word, so that they will, in the family, serve their fathers and elder brothers, and outside the family, serve their elders and superiors, then they can be made to inflict defeat on the strong armour and sharp weapons of Ch'in an Ch'u, armed with nothing but staves.
  - size of territory (and population) does not matter, only the society's values do

These other princes take the people away from their work during the bus seasons...Thus parents suffer cold and hunger while brothers, wives, and children are separated and scattered...The benevolent man has no match.
  - understands the emotional consequences of alienation by work

...
Book IV, part B
2. Hence if a man in authority has to please everyone separately, he will not find the day long enough.
  - need others, machines, media, etc. to distribute work

...
Book VI, part A
  - [TODO: could read entirely, seems to be chapter on human nature]
  - [update: still very simple.]
Kao Tzu said, 'Human nature is like the ch'i willow. Dutifulness is like cups and bowls. To make morality out of human nature is like making cups and bowls out of the willow.'

'Can you,' said Mencius 'make cups and bowls by following the nature of the willow? Or must you mutilate the willow before you can make it into cups and bowls? If you have to mutilate the willow to make it into cups and bowls, must you, then, also mutilate a man to make him moral? Surely it will be these words of yours men in the world will follow in bringing disaster upon morality.'
  - does not want to impose anything on humans, kind of anarchic


Overall, very simple ancient philosophy, usually about ethics and politics. Close to norm of society -- benevolence is mentioned a billion times.
