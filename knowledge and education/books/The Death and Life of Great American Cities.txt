Foreword:
First began to merely describe civilizing and enjoyable services that good city street life casually provides, and to deplore planning and architectural fads that were expunging them.

Foot people and car people.
I feel this concept supersedes my stereotype of city and suburb inhabitants. Some people live in cities and are car people, some live in suburbs and never know they could reach places by foot.

Problem of beauracracy, old fashioned suburbs.

Suburban sprawls cannot go on forever.

The natural world is always in flux, and so are cities.

Whenever and wherever societies have flourished and prospered rather than stagnated and decayed, creative and workable cities have been at he core of the phenomenon...Decaying cities, declining economies, and mounting social troubles travel together. The combination is not coincidental.
