people spend time to write lengthy books which wastes time on narrative, forgetting to use the medium to execute ideas. Why spend days reading?

Perhaps I am unable to consume books fast enough, which is why I enjoy travel, real life, and film to influence me. Might be better with music to concentrate, but then that means I am not thinking. I’m also faster listening. My reading speed is really slow. Either need audiobooks or learn to read faster.

Films and audiobooks play without me required to be active, it breaks that initial barrier of entering another person’s thought. Then I can think actively once I’m in it.*

I said to Jon, if one does not share an experience, was what happened real? I think as an experiential person, life and memories consists of shared times.

Listening, observing, inquiring are my greatest ways to learn. Never rewrite, sometimes failing to reinforce.

Tlon is okay, like a long invisible city.
