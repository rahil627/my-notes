Bertrand Russell's Education and Social Order:
When creating a school one must think about the herd of character one is creating.

Exceptional value in standing out against the herd.

I do not believe free education make a boy or girl incapable of manners, nor of that degree external conventions demand for. Nor do I believe the pain of conformity after a free education is nearly so great as the pain caused by the complexes of a conventional education.

Fighting evil vs slothful contentment.
