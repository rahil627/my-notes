general graph:
slow build up, peak, collapse fast; like bacteria in a petri dish.

why fall? how to perceive? how to tackle it?:

conflict of interests
  - short term interest of elites vs long term of whole*

    - Enron

conflict of values, in one situation and another
  - Greenland religion for social cohesion
  - Australia British identity
