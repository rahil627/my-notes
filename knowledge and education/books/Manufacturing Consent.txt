Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media

“Propaganda is to democracy as violence is to dictatorship.”*

We “live in webs of endless deceit, indoctrinated truths.”
  - Vietnam, etc.

Military system. The public is employed to move money toward a high tech industry. Have to deceit people.

Talking as creating*

sytactic structures -> Chomskyian revolution
  - universal grammar
  - also universal understanding — aesthetic judgement, moral, etc.*

link between anarchist convictions and human intelligence*

if it is a fundamental need to waste(?) without coercive institutions, then a decent society will maximize possibilities for them to be realized.*

decentralized systems of free associations, incorporating economic and social institutions. Anarcho-syndacalism.
  - appropriate for an advanced technological society.
  - not to be a tool, a cog in a machine

rationalist-libertarian-socialist

attach abuse of power and prevailing ideologies

social action must be named by a vision of a a future society*

seek and challenge legitimacy of forms of authority
  - sometimes justifiable, like after World War II, but must require justification**, sometimes deep-seated, attacks human rights
    - private control of resources (in addition to inequality)

short history:
1600s - English Revolution
1660 - “someone said, they have made the people thereby so curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to a civil rule”
1921 - manufacture consent
  - technique of control
  - common interests elude public opinion*

rationality belongs to the observer, requires instead of reason, faith. Emotionally potent simplification*

indoctrination is the essence of democracy.

military state = feudal state = totalitarian state
  - they all use military force to coerce

deomcracy
  - use media to control thought
  - propaganda = manufacture consent = create necessary illusions
  - reduce people to apathy

bio:
Jew / exposed to anti-semitism
grew up during The Great Depression
read French and Russian literature
Father wrote grammar book
grew up a mostly Hebrew childhood, school, camps, etc.
  - socialist zionist branch with working class values, intellectuals, soldiery, etc.
no concept of being a “good student” in Deweyite school
at age 12, wrote about Spanish Civil War, lamenting fascism of 1939
in 1930s, read news at 72nd kiosk, which was a kind of literary political salon. That was his education.


how does society work?
  - who is in position to make decisions to determine how it works?
  - investment, production, distribution
    - in capitalism, corporations staff executive positions in government, own media, and contain political and idealogical system

who is manufacturing consent?
  - 20% political class - teachers, managers, etc.
  - 80% lower class

national media is model, sets agenda for the other media
  - community media can evade this, but usually doesn’t
  - framing, selection, emphasis, delete, etc. to fit dominant interest of groups of society

New York Times creates history*

23% corporation control 50% of all media
  - through advertising profits

immoral not to do politics**

equanimity, detachment, apathy, is the only way society works, where sane people observe without action**
  - should feel guilty of war*, but they throw it on others who seem extremely(?) violent

Media should check the background of the event, offer a peaceful method, then offer a forum for debate.* Not just cover it (war).
  - War has become normal.
  - Media kept people from thinking about the possibility of war.

60% ads, 40% news.
  - 80% divert people to sports and other junk, to keep from people focusing on something that matters.*

“experiments in history” - find pairs of similar experiments, differ only in the power of authority:
Khmer Rouge / Pol Pot and East Timor / U.S.
  - East Timor is a self-reliant, egalitarian community. Invaded by Indonesia, backed by U.S. by providing 90% of arms. There was little to no coverage. UN agreed to this too.
  - Why not care? No human concern if there is profit (for the few).***

The Cambodia bombings of 600,000 people may have lead to the peasant support of Khmer Rouge, which killed another 1,000,000.

Media covered Cambodia 11x more than East Timor.

He found struggle for independence of several countries really inspiring, because the margin is so slim.
