The Poet:
Awesome little poem. :)

Between black night and many-colored lifeless,
He stands there in immutable calm,
Solitary, at a distance from the road of life.

"School Reform" A Cultural Movement:
"School reform is a cultural movement".

**School reform is positioned beyond the scientific thesis of specialists**, that it is a way of thinking, an ethical program of our time...--In short: the school reform movement brings to clear and urgent expression certain needs of our time, which, like virtually all our epoch's greatest needs, belong to the ethical-cultural sphere. School is not less important than our social and religious problem, but it is perhaps clearer.

What we want, in other words, is **cultivation** of the natural advance of humanity: **culture**. The expression of this wish of ours is: education.

Free School Community:
...The reasons are obvious. The interests if a working life, concern for humanity, have not yet narrowed the young person's horizon...the day's monotony, the uniformity of customs -- convention.

On Language as Such, and on the Language of Man:
Every expression of human mental life can be understood as a kind of language.

...all communication of the contents of the mind is language, communication in words being only a particular case of human language and of the justice, poetry, or whatever underlying it or founded on it.

The existence of language, however, is coextensive...with absolutely everything.

There is no event or thing in either animate or inanimate nature that does not in some way partake of language, for it is in the nature of each one to communicate its mental contents.
  - action and non-action(?) as communication. Inanimate things communicate? Not consciously, or does he mean it communicates something to another's mind, that it can be percepted.

For to think that we cannot imagine anything that does not communicate its mental nature in its expression is entirely meaningful; consciousness is apparently (or really) bound to such communication to varying degrees, but this cannot alter the fact that we cannot imagine a total absence of language in anything. An existence entirely without relationship to language is an idea; but this idea can bear no fruit even within that realm of Ideas whose circumference defines the idea of God.
  - we cannot imagine a total absence of language in anything? Seems like our perception of what things express / communicate to our mind.

The Centaur:
The centaur originally belongs to those periods of Greek nature in which the creation was given life through the spirit of water and the unfolding through it. "Wandering around," water is here a directionless force still belonging to chaos; later it becomes the stream with s direction, thrice pion of the life-giving proved and of the cosmos. It is also here the stagnating and hence dead element, and here it becomes seething and fermenting, the living element that gives life. It was presumably this existence dog water in the creation that Thales had in mind when he determined it to be his first principle.
  - when I read the little philosophy idea book, it said Thales took the world to be made of a single element: water. But that shirt text hides this far more complex life-force, often seen in films
