THE TIME OF THE TRIBESMICHEL MAFFESOLI (1944– )
FOCUS: Neo-tribalism
A shared social experience, or collective aesthetic sensibility, is far more important to the tribes than individuality, and the repetition of shared rituals is a way of forging strong group solidarity.
  - **events** (can include part-time jobs, family events, in addition to creative / art events, disaster relief, volunteer, political, etc.), **jams** (creative acts), meetings (productive talking, listen to other's minds, consensus decision-making, helping each other, sharing information), living together (cooking, home-making, etc.)
...
Maffesoli sees the modern-day tribes as short-lived, flexible, and fluid rather than fixed, so a person can move between different groupings in everyday life and achieve a fulfilling plural existence. Tribal membership, says Maffesoli, must be worked at and requires a shared belief or consciousness to maintain coherence.

Queer theory, like some feminist theory, was also initially critical of the lesbian and gay communities, which were seen as assimilationist—seeking to enter the mainstream by campaigning for things such as marriage rights.

Seidman is fundamentally critiquing identity- based theory and politics.

As Butler argues, in this context the marginalized identities themselves, by producing fixed meanings, become complicit in reaffirming the binary regimes. Seidman argues that queer theory provides a necessary challengeto the normative gay and lesbian politics because these sexual identities reproduce the processes of power they seek to challenge.

explores the difficulties that can arise for those who champion the politics of difference. How do social thinkers conceptualize differences, such as sexuality or race, without falling into the trap of reducing them to inferior status?

Seidman contends that a queer theoryapproach also yields a greatdeal when applied to novels and films. He argues that the goal of contemporary literary criticism has been to deconstruct the binaries present in much literature—and “queer” makes this possible.

Beck and Beck-Gernsheim suggest that nurturing personal relationships and attending to the demands of a rapidly changing economic world require a delicate balancing act; as a consequence, there is a rise in divorce. Yet so strong is the hope of happiness that many divorcees marry again.

While love between adults might be viewed as temporaryand vulnerable, love for children becomes more important, with both parents investing emotionally in their children, who are seenas providing unconditional love.

Housework in capitalist and patriarchal societies is exploitative...
...because it offers little opportunity for creativity or self-fulfillment.
 Housework is work directly opposed to self-actualization.
   - any work (is opposed to self-actualization)

 Differences between the sexes are cultural creations.
