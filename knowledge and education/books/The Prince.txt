The Prince:
Conquests by virtue (Chapter 6)

Machiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do. Part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform. Those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely. By contrast, those who stand to benefit from the new order will be less fierce in their support, because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises. Moreover, it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybody's expectations. Inevitably, he will disappoint some of his followers. Therefore, a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts, otherwise he will lose his power.

Only armed prophets, like Moses, succeed in bringing lasting change. Machiavelli claims that Moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will.

Lol, uses bible as history to describe human nature. So good.

Ch. 7
According to Machiavelli, when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime, he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter, because his power is dependent on his benefactors' goodwill. 

Machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries

Mmmm.

Ch. 8

Conquests by "criminal virtue" are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the execution of political rivals. Machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke, such that he need not commit any more wickedness for the rest of his reign. In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and his reputation can recover. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, find that their problems mushroom over time and they are forced to commit wicked deeds throughout their reign. Thus they continuously mar their reputations and alienate their people.

Wah, planning with human memory. Quick genocides are indeed often forgotten. They must be remembered by the people. Genocides caused by American government should be show lighted every year -- Vietnam, Iraq, Cuba, East Timor, Katrina, etc.

The way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself, or whether it needs to depend on allies. This does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained; a prince who is hated is also exposed.

America is indeed the most powerful, but science / tech is missing from this statement. Especially since the invention of nuclear bombs.
--

The two most essential foundations for any state, whether old or new, are sound laws and strong military forces.

Machiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces, troops borrowed from an ally, because if they win, the employer is under their favor and if they lose, he is ruined. Auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer.
--

The main concern for a prince should be war, or the preparation thereof, not books.

Wah.

Ch. 15, the bad part
The prince should, ideally, be virtuous, but he should be willing and able to abandon those virtues if it becomes necessary.
