### Scent of Money
#### How Much Is It?
Hunter-gatherers had no money...they shared their goods and services through an economy of favors and obligations. A piece of meat given for free would carry with it the assumption of reciprocity -- say, free medical assistance. The band was economically independent; ~save a few rare items traded for via barter.

An economy of favors and obligations doesn't work when large number of strangers try to cooperate; it's one thing to provide free assistance to a sister or neighbor, a very different thing to take care of foreigners who might never reciprocate the favor.

Some societies tied to solve the problem by establishing s central barter system that collected products from specialist growers and manufacturers and distributed then to those who needed them: ~Soviet Union and to a lesser extent, the Inca Empire.~ Yet most societies found a more easy way to connect large numbers of experts -- they developed money.

Money is thus a universal medium of exchange that enables people to convert almost everything into almost anything else.

...Money is the apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discrimate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age, or sexual orientation. Thanks to money, even people who don't know each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.

### The Price of Money
...But these seemingly benign principles have a dark side. When everything is convertible, and when trust depends on anonymous coins and cowry shells, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand.

#### The Hindsight Fallacy
...We study history bit to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural but inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.

#### Blind Clio
...Like evolution, history disregards the happiness of individual organisms. The individual humans, for their part, are usually far too ignorant and weak to influence the course of history to their own advantage.
