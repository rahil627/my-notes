people spend time writing lengthy books which wastes time on narrative, forgetting to use the medium to execute ideas. Why spend days reading?

perhaps I am unable to consume books fast enough, which is why I enjoy travel, real life, and film to influence me. Might be better with music to concentrate, but then that means I am not thinking. I’m also faster listening. My reading ability is really slow. I either need audiobooks or learn to read faster.
  - though, I seems to read Wikipedia and grasp concepts very fast. Perhaps I don’t read slow, but do not like the tim wasted reading superfluous words.

I said to Jon, if one does not share an experience, was what happened to real? I think as an experiential person, life and memories consists of shared times.

Listening, observing, inquiring are my greatest ways to learn. Never rewrite, sometimes failing to reinforce.

Tlon, is okay, like a long Invisible City.
