Then he laid him in the king's place and named him Charilaus because all the people there were delighted,* as well as being very impressed by his high-mindedness and justice. He had reigned for eight months altogether.

Note: Lol, so epic

Heading: Unnamed, 6.6%:

Note: * Study with the best

Heading: Unnamed, 6.6%:

Note: * Taking the best customs

Heading: Unnamed, 6.6%: 
he got on close and friendly enough terms with one of the men there who had a name for wisdom and statesmanship to send him to Sparta. This was Thales

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
Lycurgus' famous programme for educating his people.

Note: ?

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
From Crete Lycurgus sailed over to Asia 
Note: * Amazing.

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
because, we are told, like a doctor who compares unsound and sickly bodies with healthy ones, he wanted to compare the frugality and severity of the Cretan way of life with Ionian extravagance and luxury, and observe the differences between their lives and political systems.
Note: * Comparing societies, absolutely.

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
in Asia that he first came across the Homeric poems

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
designed to promote pleasure and self-indulgence, a political and educational element 
Note: ? Really?

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
had them written down and collected so that he could bring them here to Greece.
Note: Physical media!

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
but their fame is due above all to Lycurgus, who was the first to make them known here.

Note: * wow, neat

Heading: Unnamed, 6.7%: 
The Egyptians think that Lycurgus visited them as well, and was so highly impressed with their separation of the warrior castes from all the others* that he transferred the system to Sparta and made the constitution there one of genuine refinement and purity by allowing the artisans and craftsmen no part in it.*
Note: * Grabbing the best of other societies

Heading: Unnamed, 6.8%: 
Hipparchus
Note: The astronomer / mathematician!?

Heading: Unnamed, 6.8%: 
The Lacedaemonians missed Lycurgus while he was away and often asked him to return, because for them it was only the title and the prestige that distinguished their kings from the masses, whereas Lycurgus, they could see, was a natural leader with the power to get people to follow him.
Note: Hmmm, neat. Like Taiwan's presidents, or any, as opposed to a single, powerful individual

Heading: Unnamed, 6.8%: 
he set in motion a plan to effect a revolution and bring about constitutional change, because he could see no point or benefit in piecemeal legislation rather than a fresh start, 
Note: Amazing translation.

* Anyway, travel will do this. Must start over.

Heading: Unnamed, 6.9%: 
Once he had made up his mind that this was the way to proceed, he first made a trip to Delphi. After sacrificing and consulting the god, he returned to Sparta with the famous oracle in which the Pythia called him 'beloved of the gods' and 'a god rather than a man'
Note: * Decision made after travel. But where do I go to consult a god?

Heading: Unnamed, 6.9%: 
Encouraged by this, he set about winning over the best Spartiates and inviting them to help him do what had to be done.

Note: Begin the program!

Heading: Unnamed, 7%: 
Among Lycurgus' many reforms, the first and most important was the institution of the elders, who were, as Plato says, a source of security and restraint since they tempered the 'feverish' rule of the kings and had 'an equal voice in affairs of moment'.
Note: * replace King with elder council

Heading: Unnamed, 7%: 
the ballast provided by the government of the elders restored the ship of state to an even keel and enabled the constitution to find the safest possible arrangement and condition for itself, as the twenty-eight elders periodically sided with the kings when it was a matter of resisting democracy, but then supported the people to prevent the occurrence of tyranny

Heading: Unnamed, 7.1%: 
Aristotle says 
Note: Aristotle the historian! Used for politics.

Heading: Unnamed, 7.1%: 
perfect number 
Note: 4+7 != 28 ?

Heading: Unnamed, 7.1%: 
Lycurgus took the government of the elders so seriously that he brought an oracle back from Delphi about it,

Heading: Unnamed, 7.1%: 
In these words
Note: Whoa, didn't even notice the translators notes until now! This translation is so good!

Heading: Unnamed, 7.1%: 
division and distribution of the population into groups, 

Heading: Unnamed, 7.2%: 
They used to hold their assemblies between these two places, even though there were no halls or structures of any kind there, because he thought that these things made no contribution at all towards the process of sound deliberation,
Note: lololol

Heading: Unnamed, 7.2%: 
Once the general populace had gathered there, on Lycurgus' system no one was allowed to express an opinion

Heading: Unnamed, 7.2%: 
except the elders and the kings, but the people did have the authority to decide about the measures proposed by the elders and the kings. 
Note: * contemporary representative democracy

Heading: Unnamed, 7.2%: 
Polydorus and Theopompus* added a rider to the rhetra, as follows: 'However, if the people vote in favour of a deformed motion, the elders and leaders are to wield a veto'which is to say that they were not to ratify it, but to veto it altogether and to dismiss the people on the grounds that the amendments and alterations they were making to the proposal were not for the best.
Note: * simple corruption of representative democracy, also very contemporary and existing (patriot act)

Heading: Unnamed, 7.3%: 
Polydorus and Theopompus convinced their fellow citizens that it was the god who had ordained this rider
Note: * Used religion to trick lesser intelligences

Heading: Unnamed, 7.3%: 
Authority in council belongs to the god-favoured kings
Who are responsible for the lovely city of Sparta,
And to the elders, and then to the common people

Note: * Proposed hierarchy of society

Heading: Unnamed, 7.3%: 
oligarchy

Heading: Unnamed, 7.4%: 
Nothing made Lycurgus' wisdom and foresight more obvious than a survey of the misgovernment and feuding between the people and the kings that afflicted Messenia and Argos, the kinsmen and neighbours of the Lacedaemonians
Note: Knowledge simply from neighboring nations societies political systems and history

Heading: Unnamed, 7.4%: 
mixed constitution

Heading: Unnamed, 7.4%: 
But I have got ahead of my story.

Note: * :) teehee, this is nice, a bit of political philosophy mixed with history

Heading: Unnamed, 7.4%: 
The second, and the most revolutionary of Lycurgus' constitutional reforms was the redistribution of the land.
Note: *** absolutely

Heading: Unnamed, 7.4%: 
There was terrible inequality, crowds of paupers without property and without any means of support were accumulating in the city, and wealth was entirely concentrated in the hands of a few people.
Note: ***** oh how nothing changes

Heading: Unnamed, 7.5%: 
political afflictions, wealth and poverty, Lycurgus persuaded them to pool all the land and then redistribute it all over again, so that everyone would live on equal terms and with the same amount of property to provide an income.

Heading: Unnamed, 7.5%: 
In the future the only ascendancy they would seek would be assessed by the criterion of excellence
Note: * simple, but not sure of consequence

Heading: Unnamed, 7.5%: 
except as determined by criticism of shameful deeds and praise of noble ones.
Note: * perhaps a little of this

Heading: Unnamed, 7.5%: 
Putting his ideas into practice, he divided most of Laconia into 30,000 plots of land which were distributed among the perioeci,* and the part of Laconia which was assessed as belonging to the city of Sparta into 9,000 plots.* This was the number of plots in the hands of Spartiates, but some writers say that Lycurgus distributed 6,000 of them and then later Polydorus added another 3,000, while others say that Polydorus and Lycurgus were responsible for allocating 4,500
each. Each person's allotment was large enough to produce a yield of seventy medimni of barley for a man, plus twelve for his wife, and a proportionate amount of fruit,
Note: ***** amazing example of redistribution of land

Heading: Unnamed, 7.6%: 
There is a story from later in his life that once on his return from a trip abroad he was passing through the countryside just after harvest-time, and when he saw all the equal stacks of grain, one after another, he smiled and commented to the people who were with him that the whole of Laconia looked like an estate which had recently been divided between a large number of brothers.

Note: * success? :)

Heading: Unnamed, 7.6%: 
next tried to divide up their furniture too, so as to get rid of every last trace of inequality and discrepancy
Note: ***** redistribution of assets, absolutely

Heading: Unnamed, 7.6%: 
but when he saw that people were not prepared to tolerate the direct confiscation of their goods, he took a circuitous route to the same end and attacked their


Heading: Unnamed, 7.6%: 
greed by political means
Note: ***** Yessss 

Heading: Unnamed, 7.6%: 
First he revoked all gold and silver coinage and made iron the only legal tender;
Note: ***** genius

Heading: Unnamed, 7.6%: 
then he gave even a considerable weight and amount of iron such a low value that ten minas' worth needed a large storeroom in one's house and a team of cattle to transport it.* 
Note: lol

Heading: Unnamed, 7.6%: 
Once this decree was in force, many types of crime disappeared from Lacedaemon.
Note: * hmmm, neat

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
For it is said that Lycurgus had the hammered iron cooled when red hot in vinegar, which made it too brittle and unworkable to have any other use or function.

Note: * even made currency physically worthless!

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
He next set about ridding the state of useless, superfluous professions.*
Note: ***** this is amazing, and and ancient idea of mine too

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
In fact, most of them would have left along with internationally acceptable coinage, without anyone having to banish them, since there was no longer any market for their products.
Note: *** lol, true. Hmmm, restricted to national market

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
this meant that no one could buy any foreign trash, 
Note: *** Hahah, no need to import crap

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
no verbal casuist 
Note: ?

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
no vagabond diviner
Note: *** Haha, block religions, getting Japan-like isolation now

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
no keeper of prostitutes,
Note: ***** Control international trade, control social problems: no prostitutes! Wow

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
no maker of gold or silver ornaments, 
Note: No superfluous jewelers

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
Once luxury was deprived of the things that enliven it and nourish it, it gradually wasted away of its own accord
Note: **** is Plutarch dreaming with his philosophy?

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
there was no advantage in owning a great deal of property because wealth had no means of displaying itself in public, but had to stay shut up in idleness at home.
Note: ***** display of wealth as causing desire

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
essential daily utensils such as beds, chairs and tables began to be made to a high degree of excellence there
Note: ***** also seems like Japan

Heading: Unnamed, 7.7%: 
Laconian drinking-cup

Heading: Unnamed, 7.8%: 
The legislator was responsible for even this, in the sense that once craftsmen were released from non-essential work, they began to display their skill on essential items.
Note: *****

Heading: Unnamed, 7.8%: 
Lycurgus intended to eradicate admiration of wealth altogether, so he increased his assault on luxury with his third and finest reform, which was to introduce the system of common messes,


Heading: Unnamed, 7.8%: 
by which people came together to eat along with others the same specified savouries and foods.
Note: ***** yay, not really necessary, but maybe a way to force people to interact?

Heading: Unnamed, 7.8%: 
on the produce of craftsmen and cooks,
Note: ***** realizes blue collar work

Heading: Unnamed, 7.8%: 
mining themselves morally as well as physically by indulging every whim and gorging themselves until they needed long sleeps, hot baths, a great deal of quiet, and, so to speak, daily nursing.
Note: * ? Reread?

Heading: Unnamed, 7.9%: 
shared meals and simplicity of diet made wealth no wealth is even more important. For when rich and poor went to the same meal, the rich could not even use or enjoy, let alone gaze upon or display, all their paraphernalia
Note: * :)

Heading: Unnamed, 7.9%: 
because everyone else was alert to the possibility, and they used to watch out for people who would not drink or eat with them and taunt them for their lack of self-control and for being too delicate to take the common diet.

Note: * hahah, awesome

Heading: Unnamed, 7.9%: 
It was apparently this reform above all which made the rich members of Spartan society angry with Lycurgus.

Note: * lol, food indeed will make the rich angry

Heading: Unnamed, 8%: 
This injury did not make Lycurgus give in, however. He stood and confronted his fellow citizens, showing them his bloody face and ruined eye. They were so overcome by remorse and horror at the sight that they handed Alcander over to him and escorted him home, unanimous in their outrage at what Alcander had done. Lycurgus thanked them and sent them all away with the exception of Alcander, 
Note: ***** Solidarity with the people

Heading: Unnamed, 8%: 
he took inside. He did him no harm, however, and did not even tell him off, but dismissed his usual servants and attendants and told Alcander to attend to him instead. 
Note: * huh, this shit is too good

Heading: Unnamed, 8%: 
As he lived with Lycurgus and shared his life, he came to observe his self-possession and high-mindedness, his ascetic lifestyle, and his inexhaustible capacity for hard work, and he became extremely attached to him

Heading: Unnamed, 8%: 
So this was Alcander's punishment, and the penalty he had to undergo was to change from being an insubordinate, badly behaved young man to a very well-mannered and responsible adult.
Note: * Justice served with education!

Heading: Unnamed, 8.1%: 
Dioscorides, who wrote a monograph on the Laconian constitution) 
Note: Wow, monographs written during that time?

Heading: Unnamed, 8.1%: 
the Lacedaemonians call them phiditia, either because they promote friendship ( philia) and loyalty, with a 'd' in place of the '1', or because they train men in frugality and thrift ( pheido *). 
Note: * :)

Heading: Unnamed, 8.1%: 
They used to meet in groups of fifteen, give or take a little either way
Note: * good size table

Heading: Unnamed, 8.1%: 
Each member of the group would bring per month a medimnus of ground barley, eight choes of wine, five minas of cheese, two and a half minas of figs, and also a very small sum of money for the purchase of savouries.* 
Note: * wow, even then they had enough luxury. And here I am in Taiwan starving.

Heading: Unnamed, 8.2%: 
if anyone had made a sacrifice of first fruits or had been out hunting, he sent a portion to his mess;

Heading: Unnamed, 8.2%: 
eating at home was permitted if one had made a sacrifice or got back late from hunting, even though everyone else had to be at the mess

Heading: Unnamed, 8.2%: 
custom of eating together 

Heading: Unnamed, 8.2%: 
polemarchs fined him
Note: * loll, Plutarch's stories and examples are so epic

Heading: Unnamed, 8.2%: 
They used to listen to political discussions and watch entertainments suitable for free men, and they themselves were taught to entertain others and tell jokes without descending to vulgarity, and to be teased without getting annoyed. 

Heading: Unnamed, 8.2%: 
particular feature of Laconian character: the ability to take a joke
Note: Probably need it for being so ascetic

Heading: Unnamed, 8.3%: 
carried by a slave on his head.
Note: ***** first mention of slave

Heading: Unnamed, 8.3%: 
If they find even one squashed piece of bread in the basket, the candidate is refused entry, since they want everyone to be happy with everyone else's company.
Note: * hmmm, politics at the level of 15 people. Yeah, same happens in shares households, even with two people.

Heading: Unnamed, 8.3%: 
kaddished
Note: cool

Heading: Unnamed, 8.3%: 
The savoury dish they rate most highly is their famous black broth

Heading: Unnamed, 8.3%: 
kings of Pontus actually bought a Laconian cook because he wanted to try the broth, and when he found that he did not like the taste of it
Note: * hah, Laconian taste

Heading: Unnamed, 8.4%:

Note: lol, silly

Heading: Unnamed, 8.4%: 
Lycurgus did not commit his laws to writing; in fact, one of the so-called rhetras expressly forbids it
Note: ***** absolutely, laws don't need writing. It's only about actual human behavior, and actually shaping through education.

Heading: Unnamed, 8.4%: 
was of the opinion that the principles which make the most substantial and important


Heading: Unnamed, 8.4%: 
contribution towards the prosperity and excellence of a state remain stable if they are implanted in the characters and training of the citizens,
Note: ***** precisely

Heading: Unnamed, 8.4%: 
form a stronger bond than compulsion

Heading: Unnamed, 8.4%: 
recreates the intention of the legislator in each and every person
Note: ***** not well translated, but what is meant to be said is beautiful.

Heading: Unnamed, 8.4%: 
minor business contracts, where the details change from occasion to occasion according to the requirements of the particular case, were best left unrestricted by written constraints and unchangeable conventions, so that they could have clauses added or deleted as the occasion would demand and as educated men would decide. 
Note: ***** no strict social contracts, just simple ones

Heading: Unnamed, 8.5%: 
In short, from start to finish he made all his legislation depend on education, and that is why, as I have already mentioned, one of his rhetras prohibited the use of written laws.

Note: ***** beautiful, fuck America, go Taiwan

Heading: Unnamed, 8.5%: 
there was another rhetra against extravagance, stating that in house-building only an axe should be used to make the roof, and that a saw and no other tool was to be used in making the doors.
Note: *** Again, informal laws against display of wealth

Heading: Unnamed, 8.5%: 
a house like that does not promote luxury and extravagance, and there is no one vulgar or stupid enough to bring into a simple, everyday house silver-footed couches, purple-dyed covers, golden cups, and all the extravagance that goes with such things.
Note: *** maybe before, but now that space is limited, this does occur, in high-rises!

Heading: Unnamed, 8.5%: 
whether trees grew square in Corinth.

Note: lol, you must be making this shit up Plutarch

Heading: Unnamed, 8.6%: 
third rhetra issued by Lycurgus which forbade repeated campaigns against the same enemy, in order to avoid them getting used to defending themselves and so becoming expert fighters.
Note: ***** nice

Heading: Unnamed, 8.6%: 
What an excellent way the Thebans have found to pay you for the lessons you gave them when they had neither the inclination nor the expertise to fight!'*

Note: Todo: reread, translation has some very long running sentences

Heading: Unnamed, 8.6%: 
they called these decrees of his 'rhetras' because they regarded them as oracular utterances brought to Sparta from the god.*

Note: * still ideas from God

Heading: Unnamed, 8.6%: 
He thought that there was no field more important or worthwhile for the legislator than education, so he began to tackle the topic from a remote point, with a review, right at the start of his legislation, of the regulations concerning marriage and childbirth
Note: ***** a society centered about education, amazing

Heading: Unnamed, 8.7%: 
In actual fact, Lycurgus made all the provisions he could for women. He instigated a tough regime of physical exercise for unmarried women, involving running, wrestling, discus, and javelin, so that when the time came for embryos to take root in their wombs they would gain a healthy start in healthy bodies and develop well, while the women themselves would have the strength to endure childbirth and would cope well and easily with the trials of labour. He removed their physical frailty, stopped them spending all their time indoors, and in general got rid of their femininity; he made girls just as used as boys to parading naked,* and to dancing and singing at certain festivals, with young men present as spectators
Note: *** hmmm, interesting!

Heading: Unnamed, 8.7%: 
All this used to fill the young men with ambition and rivalry, because anyone who was praised for his manly qualities and acquired a favourable reputation among the young women left feeling proud that he had won their praise, while their light-hearted taunts stung just as much as serious rebukes

Heading: Unnamed, 8.8%: 
There was nothing shameful in the young women's nakednessnever a trace of lewdness, but only modesty. On the contrary, nudity accustomed them to simplicity and made them admire physical fitness
Note: *** this is great

Heading: Unnamed, 8.8%: 
It also gave women a taste for a positive kind of pride, since excellence and ambition were just as much for them as for men. 

Heading: Unnamed, 8.8%: 
As a result women learnt to speak and think
Note: ***** wow, learned to think and speak, because motivated by the social system

Heading: Unnamed, 8.8%: 
When some womana foreigner, apparently


Heading: Unnamed, 8.8%: 
said to her, 'You Laconian women are the only ones who control your men', she replied, 'That's because we're the only ones Who give birth to men.'

Note: Ohhhh snap, lol, Plutarch

Heading: Unnamed, 12.4%: 
His friends and relatives, however, instituted a kind of school which met for many years, and called the days when they met 'Lycurgan days'

Heading: Unnamed, 12.4%: 
Aristocrates
Note: * word origin!? lol

Heading: Unnamed, 64.7%: 
I am not writing history but biography, and the most outstanding exploits do not always have the property of revealing the goodness or badness of the agent; often, in fact, a casual action, the odd phrase, or a jest reveals character better than battles involving the loss of thousands upon thousands of lives, huge troop movements, and whole cities besieged.
Note: *** :)

Heading: Unnamed, 64.8%: 
just as a painter reproduces his subject's likeness by concentrating on the face and the expression of the eyes, by means of which character is revealed, and pays hardly any attention to the rest of the body, I must be allowed to devote more time to those aspects which indicate a person's mind and to use these to portray the life of each of my subjects, while leaving their major exploits and battles to others.*

Note: *** :)
