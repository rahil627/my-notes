Thoughts after 25 minutes of A History of Rome by Hadas Moses:

The format is wonderful: chronological ordered narrative with huge quotes from ancient sources[, starting with Livy]. It reads like one huge story.

But, is it worth reading such text? It's so unreal. Granted it does start with the more legendary ancient stuff. Can *anything* be learned? I highlighted and noted so few bits, especially when compared to, say, [Georg Simmel](Simmel), or any biography: In a biography I can try to see why a person takes the actions that they did; In philosophy,
I can match many of my own ideas to the philosopher's, picking up some words, mapping some ideas together. But reading a narrative (political) history seems as dull to the mind as reading s narrative fictional book: There is no social reality to to try to understand actions; There are no ideas to better understand the world and people's mind.

I will continue, but I think, watching any sort of socially real film is a far better use of time.
