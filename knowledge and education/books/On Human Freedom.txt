“To those intent on living quietly”

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

[1] “**Remember, it isn’t just desire for power and money that makes a man humble and deferential towards others, but also desire for the opposite – for a life of peace and quiet, of travel and scholarship.** | **It is a general rule that externals of any kind, if we attach importance to them, make us subject to somebody.**”
  - [todo: **holy shit, that last sentence could be the start of a writing.**] Attachment to material: property, house, home, community, city, sense of place and lives: people (family, friends, neighbors, other nations), animals, nature. Once we *attach* to them, we are subject to

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[4] Why do you want to read anyway – for the sake of amusement or mere erudition? Those are poor, fatuous pretexts. **Reading should serve the goal of attaining peace; if it doesn’t make you peaceful, what good is it?**”

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[19] As it is, though, we fail to realize how little we differ from the mass of men, the only difference being that they are afraid they will not hold office, while you are afraid you will. Don’t act that way; ”

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[21] **If you would dictate to circumstance, how can you emulate Socrates, who said, ‘If it pleases the gods, so be it’?
Do you think Socrates would have been as ready to serve on so many campaigns if he had longed to linger in the Academy or the Lyceum every day, conversing with young men? No, he would have groused and grumbled, ‘Hell, here I am in misery when I might be back in the Lyceum sunning myself.’ Is that your job, sunning yourself? [22] Isn’t it rather to be happy, unflappable and equal to every occasion? How could he have remained Socrates, had he yielded to disaffection? How would he have been the same man who wrote hymns of praise behind prison walls?**

[23] Just keep in mind: **the more we value things outside our control, the less control we have. And among things outside our control is not only access to, but relief from, public office; not just work, but leisure too.**”

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[26] Similarly, someone says, ‘I don’t like leisure, it’s boring; I don’t like crowds, they’re a nuisance.’ But if events ordain that you spend time either alone or with just a few other people, look upon it as tranquillity and play along with it for the duration. Talk to yourself, train your thoughts and shape your preconceptions. If, on the contrary, you happen upon a crowd, call it a sporting event, a festival or celebration, [27] and try to keep holiday with the people. What could better please a person who loves his fellow man than the sight of them in numbers? We like to see herds of cows or horses, we delight in the sight of a fleet of boats; why hate the sight of a gathering of human beings?”

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[29] Just keep in mind the central questions: ‘What is mine, what is not mine? What has been given to me? What does God want me to do, or not do, now?”

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[33] ‘But how can I do it?’
You’ve often heard how – you need to suspend desire completely, and train aversion only on things within your power. You should dissociate yourself from everything outside yourself – the body, possessions, reputation, books, applause, as well as office or lack of office. Because a preference for any of them immediately makes you a slave, a subordinate, and prone to disappointment. [34] Keep Cleanthes’ verse handy:
Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny.”
  - 33 is core stoicism
  - 34 is very Tao like, flowing with the way: fate, etc.

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“Do I have to go to Rome? Then I go to Rome. To Gyara? All right, I go to Gyara instead. To Athens? Then Athens it is. To jail? Well then I go to jail. [35] But if you ever think, ‘When do we get to go to Athens?’ you are already lost. Either you’re going to be depressed when your wish is not realized or foolishly pleased with yourself if it is, overjoyed for the wrong reasons. And next time, if you’re not so lucky, you’ll grow disconsolate when events are not so much to your liking. [36] Give them all up.
‘But Athens is lovely.’
It would be lovelier still if you could secure happiness, free of emotion, poised and dependent on no one except yourself.
‘And Rome is all crowds and sycophancy.’
  - hah, attachment to places, must detach and be at peace with one’s self

[37] **But the reward for enduring such inconveniences is peace.** So if this is the time for them, **why not conquer your aversion?** Why endure them like a donkey hit by sticks? [38] Otherwise, look, you will always have to serve the person who is able to secure your release, or the person who can block your way. You will have to serve him the way you would an evil deity.
  - conquer aversion, go head-on into any environment, don’t avoid

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[39] There is one road to peace and happiness (keep the thought nearby morning, noon and night): renunciation of externals; regarding nothing as your own; handing over everything to fortune and the deity. Leave those things in the care of the same people God appointed to govern them, [40] while you devote yourself to the one thing that is truly yours and that no one can obstruct; make that the focus of all your reading, your writing and your lecture attendance.”
  - core stoicism

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[45] Bearing all this in mind, **welcome present circumstances and accept the things whose time has arrived.** [46] Be happy when you find that doctrines you have learned and analysed are being tested by real events. If you’ve succeeded in removing or reducing the tendency to be mean and critical, or thoughtless, or foul-mouthed, or careless, or nonchalant; if old interests no longer engage you, at least not to the same extent; then **every day can be a feast day – today because you acquitted yourself well in one set of circumstances, tomorrow because of another.**”

Excerpt From: Epictetus. “Of Human Freedom.” iBooks. 

“[47] How much better cause is this to celebrate than becoming consul or governor; because you have yourself to thank, and the gods. **Remember, then, who is responsible for the gift, to whom it was given, and for what reason. [48] With these thoughts, can you doubt where your future happiness lies, or how you will best please God?** Is it not the same distance to God everywhere? Are not events equally visible from every vantage point?”
  - you are responsible for your own happiness.
