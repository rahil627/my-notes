Civic Development
# 1
Made progress in science, but what about human nature, through psychology?

What we lack, is a genuinely systematic psychology, like Aristotle's. (See other note).

# 2
(See other note)

Experience nature: animal behavior, etc. Prescient understanding how animals behave. "Always something new in Libya."

(See other note)

**Ethological character. There is a recognition that the physical conditions of life incline us in one place or another: climate, food, maritime nation (diverse goods and people), early rearing (Aristotle did tutor Alexander!), poetry, and the political community; the polis.**

Even if he made a wrong general conclusion, it's likely coming just from sheer observation of the few cases he has. If he says women eats less, it's probably because the men at the time were doing labor intensive jobs, and serving the army, and exercising often.

**The polis precedes the family and the individual.** If family is simply just hereditary relatedness of animals, than family hasn't been reached. But **when we say family, has to do with the duties, responsibilities, obligations, to each family member, including handling economic things. And all of that comes about in a political context, which requires the polis, it's laws and customs.**

**An individual can exist in the wild, but how does an individual have a personal identity? They have an occupation, a housewife, a hoplite, etc, which derives from a political context.**
  - I feel this way now. No identity. No job. No social life. No community. No polis.

Polis, not just a state with set of laws, constitution, etc, but **politics as just that minimal degree of principled affiliation, constitutive of a community, that is an ongoing and enduring community, enduring in virtue of values and principles that it upholds, and the youngsters are brought up to uphold and revere.**
  - **beautiful**
  - I currently feel pretty good about Taiwan in this sense.
  - at a smaller level, I need to find a good community. A good set of friends. A shared space? Or create one. Here, I only feel Babycastles is good, and other well-valued communities.

Aristotle constantly compare other animals to humans.

**Epistimoticon, a particular kind of rational power to be able to create a framework, a general, universal set of rules to follow.**
  - worth re-listening to. Like the idea that everything is a game.

**But as children, we don't have that power. He constantly compared children to animals.**

**"Man, when tamed by law, is the best of animals; but outside of law, is the very worst of animals."** harking Homer here.

To Aristotle, the point of humanity is to be reasonable, productive, virtue. Control emotions, etc.

If a parent doesn't do their duty / office, then they bring into the world a beast (stateless, hearth-less, man).
  - Taiwan is quite good at creating beasts

Ostracism (being a beast, a threat to society) existed in law and was enforced, penalty was exiled. Though Athens had many problems, there was a character and tone to life that people aspired to.
  - Sounds like xenophobia. It's impossible to be a beast
in Japan's society. Not good. Not altruistic. Should care for beasts.
  - maybe Japan is Aristotle's utopia

Whats our mission? Moral and intellectual virtues, etc. **You cannot have a bad state with good citizens (and families), and vice versa; Because the flourishing individual (and family) is a reflection of the polis (it's values, customs [culture], laws).**
  - beasts can be raised in Taiwan because it itself is
good at caring form them. Beasts don't obey laws, but still appreciates their view. It's okay to be a buddhist, a carnivore, or a capitalist. What's most important is to appreciate all minds, whatever rules they've built in their heads. The polis that reflects that, is my favorite, and that is indeed why I love Taiwan.

**A developed psychology certainly will have to be one that will be associated to the political reality of the world which that life develops, and the rest of psychology may be interesting, but painfully incomplete.**
  - must factor everything in, so the little psychology tests in labs don't matter much when you are homeless, or heartbroken
