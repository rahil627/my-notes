  - here is no scientific definition of what boredom actually is, and no one knows what part of the brain controls the sensation of boredom. However, science has found the pleasure and excitement center of the brain. During new or entertaining experiences, neurotransmitters in the brain release dopamine, a chemical that gives us the sensation of joy and excitement. Some people have naturally low levels of dopamine in their brains. These people might need more intense experiences to get that feeling of joy. Conversely, they might be more prone to feeling "bored" when they aren't getting enough stimulation to release dopamine. Scientists have also found that our perception of boredom can be affected by our sense of passing time, which is managed by the frontal cortex in the brain. A study of people with damage to the frontal cortex found that they were more likely to experience boredom and have greater urges to take risks
