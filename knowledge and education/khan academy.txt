raising money for a startup:
assets = liability + equity
equity (net worth, shareholders equity) - owner's value in the assets

angel investor - rich people willing to take risks. The chance of a venture being successful is low,  but the payoff is really high.
seed venture capitalist - manage other people's money
series A

round financing

banks only loan an amount they feel you would be willing to pay
can put collateral down to increase loan amount

dilution - shares increase

the amount an angel investor loans directly affects how much of the company he owns.

then when a seed venture capitalist invests in the company, they get shares.

then when another seed venture capitalist (series B) invests in a company they get shares. Note that if the value of the company increased, than the amount/share increased, so the company will be giving less shares for more money.

initial public offering (IPO) - can be used to raise more money, also the investors can exchange shares for money. On the public stock exchange (NASDAQ, New York stock exchange)

lead underwriter - legal work, model projections
syndicate - group of banks, investment banks (although they are now all commercial), lead by the underwriter

the underwriter and syndicate tell their customers (hedge funds, brokerage accounts) about the company. The company "goes public". The lead underwriter and syndicate get 7% of the shares for about two months of work

prime brokerage account - a brokerage account for big guys

secondary market - when you buy a share from IBM, you're not actually investing in the company, you're buying it from someone else

why even buy a share from an IPO?
dividend - cash given to shareholders
or maybe the companies gets bought out for a higher price
