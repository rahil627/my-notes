Data:

old inputs:

inputs:
people
animals - paths
transportation

sound
smell
vision - light sensor or camera
taste?
feel - pressure sensor


outputs:
screen
3d printer
machine with material

ideas:
input: track bums, output: ?. Further thinking: can track the heartbeat of bums, once they die, it is displayed in 
public somehow, and a rat is killed?

track rats, output: MTA maps with rat paths overlayed, post in subways over original maps.

input: sound from street musician, output: sound to speaker above ground. Further thinking: can have a mic in a concert and a speaker outside of it, enclose a public area, then charge people to get in it.

input: object, output: object of lower price. Barter vending machine. Need three fingerprints to have witnesses of pricing. Can test in real life, no machine.
