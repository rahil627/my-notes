Day to day perception does not match reality

Temptation of meaning - finding meaning in horrible things, denying reality

An event where reality hits, one may become more aware of reality.

Nature is not an organism, it's a series of catastrophes.

The ideology of ecology is conservative.

Alienation from nature in tech world? Know dangers?

Disavowel - knowing but not acting upon

What to do? Get to our roots in nature, not by going to nature, but by going to trash.

Zizek' argument is simply this: day to day perception does not match reality, especially with respect to ecology.

He feels people have knowledge of reality but do not take action towards it.

He feels should be struck by an event which strikes people out of their daze and remind them to be aware of more realities.

His answer is to accept the reality of nature, including what human have created, because that is part of nature too.
