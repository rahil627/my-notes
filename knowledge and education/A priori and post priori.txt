intuition and concepts
 - intuitions are immediate representations of an object; space and time. i.e. a full chair
 - concepts are mediate representations; causality: i.e. brown, wood, rigid, four-legged

the canon of pure reason
What can I know? We cannot know, through reason, anything that can't be a possible sense experience; ("that all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt")

--
Todo: move this elsewhere?
What should I do? Do that which will make you deserve happiness;
What may I hope? We can hope to be happy as far as we have made ourselves deserving of it through our conduct.
