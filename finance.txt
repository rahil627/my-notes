# Paypal
Why not just use my Taiwan debit card to add money to Paypal?

https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Account-balance-Archive/Add-money-using-debit-card/td-p/369996
  - “You can add money to your PayPal account from a bank account, there is not a way to add money from your debit card. If you are not able to add your bank account to your PayPal account you may want to purchase a Green Dot MoneyPak card. Take your cash to one of these retails store near you: Wal-Mart, Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Kmart or 7 Eleven. Once you purchase the card log into your PayPal account and click add funds (under My Account) and select the MoneyPak option..”
    - Green Dot MoneyPak (aka Paypal-Cash?), some sort of card with visa / master-card, but no line of credit on it. Terrible reviews. Monthly fees. Reloading fees.

# Bitcoin

Loans:
HSBC in Taiwan - ridiculous requirements

Dad

Wells Fargo credit line. Have an APR, quite high, 9-18%? Instant loan, depending on amount, and can then transfer to Schwab (3 days), then get cash. No worry about payments, but have APR.

Wells Fargo 0% APR credit card, but would need to pay minimum on time, and very likely, there is APR on cash advance, so have to purchase PayPal.
  - can use PayPal to make a purchase (3% commission) by creating another account. One with bank, one with credit card. These transfers would be done near instantly because it is credit.

Best option seems to be to use 0% APR card with PayPal, as it wastes the least money (no APR and possibility of no transfer fee, but likely 3% transfer fee)

The most convenient option is the credit line, taking only how much I need. (Todo: ask if it requires a minimum payments, also ask actual APR)

# other methods to transfer money
from an e-mail to Jon:
“Otherwise I can send the money to one of my banks and eat a transfer fee ($25 Charles Schwab, $30+ Wells Fargo) to another friend. Ughhhh, hate to give an American bank money.”…”There's even a fee for incoming transfers of like $12 (+ the normal outgoing, which is normally a lot in America).”
  - so, $12 incoming + ~$400NT+ (todo: check amount) outgoing.

from living in east side Taiwan.txt
“I’ve checked many options, and it's really just Bitcoin (no fees? instant? :0 ), which I haven't done the research for, and then the strange bullshit: Western Union and MoneyGram (and others?), which have $12 and $17.50 fees + actual currency exchange fee + bullshit fee within the currency exchange fee. Unfortunately, I fear, these are my only choices at the moment.”



# current bank accounts:

      - 400NT$+ (300 + 100 + x) for outgoing international transfer
      - 200-800NT$ for incoming international transfer
      - but, need an ARC to access online banking
      - furthermore, only works with Taiwan’s Paypal (NT$ as opposed to $)? Maybe.
      - must make sure the name on the account matches the Paypal account name

money markets
People tend to confuse money market FUNDS (MMFs) with money market ACCOUNTS (MMAs). They're two different things. MMFs are not FDIC insured, even if bought through a bank. Yes, some banks now offer MMFs, just as some offer stocks and mutual funds, but these are not deposit accounts and are not FDIC-insured.

MMAs, on the other hand, are deposit accounts, are FDIC-insured and are typically what's offered at banks.
