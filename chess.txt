Kasparov - best
Fischer - second to third best if he played. game of the century at 13, 8 US championships starting at 14, grandmaster at 15, most dominant player/undefeatable many tournaments, arrest warant for playing chess in embargoed Yugoslavia, fled to many countries, denounced bush (H.W.) as a criminal and japan as a puppet
Waitzkin - protagonist in the movie, stopped playing after becoming an international master at 16, went to martial arts - brazilian jiu-jitsu
Jeffrey Sarwer - "Jeff at nine is stronger than Bobby was at 11."
Karpov - second best. "boa constrictor" style of play, influenced by idol capablanca. taking no risk, but reacting mercilessly to any tiny errors made by his opponents.
Capablanca - Capablanca excelled in simple positions and endgames, and his positional judgment was outstanding, so much so that most attempts to attack him came to grief without any apparent defensive efforts on his part. wrote the book, Chess Fundamentals. denied reports that he thought chess had already currently reached it was easy for top players to obtain a draw. his concern led to the creation of larger boards with more peices. he thought this would prevent technical knowledge from becoming such a dominant factor, at least for a few centuries.

chess openings have a main line and variations

general thinking
In general, don't waste time by moving the same piece twice in an opening; get your other pieces developed first.
Material sacrifices are likely to be effective if your opponent's king is still in the middle and a central file is open.

principles
you should not move the same peice more than once in the openings

my thoughts
more about development and advancement - moving peices forward. getting all pieces into the game
king safety - castling
try to protect every peice
checking their king forces them to move, sometimes in unwanted places
focus on learning in an random environment rather than chess openings
black is defence, white is offence. 1 mistake changes the tempo
