notes from Chiang Mai:
kitchenware:
  - a wok
    - a wok funnels the oil to the center so you don�t have to worry about covering the pan or burning the oil away (by using too much heat)

curries:
  - see organic chiang mai cook book [todo: get name]

pan-fry curry paste, add water to prevent it from burning, for a few minutes. Then add half water half coconut cream, and cook it until it simmers. Let any vegetables simmer with it.

common additions: chilis (fresh green), lemon-grass, lime...

notes:
  - can cook spices along-side the curry-paste and cook vegetables along-side with the curry (once you add water �n coconut cream). Or:
    - once the curry is cooked, can refrigerate it, and then re-heat it later along-side cooking vegetables
  - some curries use all water (: red), some curries use half water half coconut cream(?) (: green, penang).
-

rice with boiled vegetables (kichdi):
cook this using a rice-cooker. Add a little tumeric, a little salt, and whatever vegetables you want to boil (peas, beans, etc.).
-

rice with vegetables that require pre-cooking (tastier kichdi):
pan-fry the vegetables first: onions, chilis, garlic, etc. Once cooked, throw it into the rice cooker.

note: I feel that the pan-fried mix loses much of it�s flavor once they are boiled in a rice-cooker. I think it�s way better to keep them separate, as the mix will maintain the flavor, even when refrigerated.
    - or: just pan-fry afterward to make fried rice, which is much tastier.
ref: https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/moong-dal-khichdi-recipe/
  - quite a solid site: a clear, simple, easy-to-understand flow
-

fried rice (fried kichdi):
cook the rice (with taste-less vegetables to be boiled: peas), then pan-fry it with spices (: onions, garlic, ginger, etc.) and more vegetables (: eggplant).
-

thai tea:
boil tea, let it sit until it cools, and then strain it (and trash it)
  - can boil a whole pot-full and store it in the fridge for easy use

if using condensed milk or sugar, it�s easier to mix with warmer water first, then can add ice later.

other-wise, just add creamer on top.

notes:
on creamers:
  - condensed milk is half sugar (a bad kind? palm sugar?) and has an ice-cream taste and texture
  - canned evaporated milk is just a denser milk (like �half �n half�, which is half cream half milk), and creates a fresh milk taste to it
  - [cane] sugar can be used for a more lighter taste than condensed milk


notes from Pingdong Place of Arts:
kitchenware:
  - use stainless steel (or, perhaps some other high chromium steel), as other materials may leach into food

vegetables that don't require cooking
  - greens
  - short-rooted vegetables (carrots, turnips, etc.)
  - probably can just throw most vegetables into a steamer (rice cooker) for a few minutes and eat anyway
    - maybe just need a little salt is all

cooking:
  - start with oil
    - make sure pan is good
    - must use low heat or else things will just burn?
    - covering surface of pan is better
      - pro-tip: can use a small baking cup (better if nonstick found [todo: is steel okay?]) for cooking just the oil and spices, then adding that to grains
    - cooking order: chiles > garlic and ginger > hard vegetables > soft vegetables > spices > cooked grains > spices

grains:
  - noodles
    - **ramen > hand-cut** > others > rice > bean
    - buckwheat is heavy
  - rice
    - white rice is gross
    - multi-grain (10) rice gives me gas
    - **maybe need to find thai rice / sticky rice**
  - dry cereals
    - oats / multi-grain with oats
      - oatmeal is a good as a snack for cold days, or late night
        - can add anything, fruit, cinnamon / brown sugar, etc., similar to spices add to make American dessert cakes
      - can eat dry, but isn't crispy like **industrial cereals or granola**

  - simple recipes, like my own

Cook simply, like Ching. Use a small amount or no sugar and salt. Also use a small amount of spices, extracting most of the taste from the food. Buy whatever is cheap at the local supermarket, because it is likely in season.

tips:
steam vegetables
use a steamer or rice cooker to reheat food
  - [to save gas? And because it cooks cleanly, unlike microwave.]
  - if not, use oven
use all parts of food
little to no plain carbs (bread, rice, etc.)

real cooking:
almost all recipes have garlic and/or ginger
see gordon ramsey videos
asian milk tea and chai

meat soup
  - beef
  - lamb
  - chicken

in a seperate small pot, cook oil, place mustard seeds and a dry chili inside, throw the concoction into the daal
let the daal simmer to allow the masala to seep in

Steamed Vegetables
Boil water, place vegetables in, close lid, cook for 2-6 minutes depending on vegetable and quantity. Should use a collander or steamer basket.

Pork chops

Ingredients:
Oil
Rosemary leaves
Seasoned Salt
Pepper

Season the chops with salt and pepper. Using a heavy pan (cast iron, steel), cook the chops for 3-5 minutes, or until the edges come up slightly. Rub rosemary between your palm and let it fall on the chops, Flip it (without a fork).  Add some more rosemary. Cook until the new side's edges come up. Take them out when it's done (can flip/reflip if needed). Add water/wine/broth and scrape the brown bits off. This deglazes the pan. Let the liquid boil (In cooking terms, this is called "reducing". In fat guy terms, this is called "making gravy"). Once the liquid has boiled almost all the way off, you'll notice a new sound. Quickly, add some butter, start swirling the liquid around, add the chops back to the pan, coat both sides, take it out, and enjoy.

or make a marinade out of it:
1/2/4 cup soy sauce
1/4/4 cup water
3/4 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 tablespoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 pork chop

cover cup and let it steep for 1-5 minutes (try 3 minutes, less for green)

if the cup of tea tastes bitter/harsh it may have been overbrewed

Air, light, heat, and moisture are the four enemies of tea. Store tea in a container and it will stay fresh for up to a year. Green tea will lose quality quicker.
