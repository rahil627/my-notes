from a recent thought:
Need to help mom. Devise a plan? Can it be done in a week? Nah, that would only work for a short-term. Come back for her later? Talk to Dad about it? The only way I can help is if I am doing well myself. I need to live in an exciting environment; A city. The solution is for her to live with me in a city.

question for shivani:
Does pyschotherapy (creating an ideal environment) help? Such as having a supportive family, a job that rewards (crafting, cooking), etc.
Is it possible to treat (or nearly treat) schizophrenia with psychotherapy or does it always exist? Or is there just a random chance for psychotic episodes to occur.
What are the most important factors in pyschotherapy? Encouragement, feeling needed for the family/world?
