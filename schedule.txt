Current track: pcomp and materials, design for low-income -- see recent DIY innovations, creative software to create new media, physical games, chinese, spanish, Babycastles, guerrilla film-making practice for future money and filming abroad, also photography for inspiration, cheap zoom consumer camera, or iPhone attachment?

Those are all surface projects. None dig deep for knowledge, my understanding of the world.

See syllabuses. Compare. Choose.
