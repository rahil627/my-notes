why isn't this on by default!? - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d14azbfh.aspx

value types - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1ax56ch.aspx

from notes when working at Segin:

catches:

view -> components

IQueryable is case insensitive, IEnumerable is case sensitive


C#/.NET:
nullable variable.value to get non-null value
extension method - static f(this datatype) { ... }
"" == String.empty == (stringVar.length == 0)
datatype keywords are associated to classes - int == int32, short == int16, try to use the class
parameterized queries - avoids SQL injection
data context - contains data classes and stored procedures
entity framework - object relational mapping (ORM), supports all databases, has more features
