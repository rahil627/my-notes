“If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program.”
  - an interesting maxim to abide, but, maybe ‘causes too much refactoring!


naming conventions:
avoid using the shift modifier key
- hyphens > underscores
- thingGroups > groupOfThings
  - thingGroup, thingSuperGroup is easier to auto-complete than groupOfThings, superGroupOfThings. Though the second way feels right to say English, the first way is better.

structure of a class / data bundle:
  - variables on top... make it possible to read from top to bottom being able to understand everything that’s going on without scrolling down. Let the auto-generated IDE stuff tell you the public API.

single header-file ideal:
  - try to put everything in one file, so that there are no dependencies beyond that one file. This makes it highly portable / distributable.
