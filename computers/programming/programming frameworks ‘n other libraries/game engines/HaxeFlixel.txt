meh, decided to use HaxePunk for everything

learn:
  - google extend FlxObject or FlxBasic, like CCNode?* GOOGLE THIS
    - then use FlxObject.x and FlxObject.y
    - even if you add it, you still have to call sprite.update, sprite.destroy, sprite.draw, the x and y is not linked to this object, FlxObject does not contain a list of FlxBasic like FlxGroup does, for now, just extend FlxSprite and keep the code in there, although it does not make sense
    - have to use FlxGroup (a glorified array) to change the values of multiple objects easily
    - should add the child object to the state within the parent class, and alter whatever you need to within it, if needed

two nme.display.Sprite class instances:
camera._effectsLayer?
FlxG.flashSprite?
