  - iOS setup
    - the default project file auto-rotates the screen and HXP.screen.width and HXP.screen.height are not adjusted accordingly
    - something is wrong with HXP.screen.height*
      - try setting to landscape mode*
  - iOS workflow
    - nme build ios builds a 200MB file, I've got a SSD, I hope you do too
    - nme clean ios, when shit goes down or when update does not detect changes
    - nme update ios, for everything else
    - nme update iOS does not detect changes in the nmml file*
  - integrating nme
  - integrating physics

HXP.sprite is just for reuse, it's not actually added to the Engine (Sprite) class
can add nme.display.sprite to either HXP.stage or HXP.engine

shoulds:
  - use bitmap drawings and just scale them in game. When the size is figured out, then resize the image. This is much better than creating vector graphics with flash.
  
gotchas:
  - centering the registration point is weird
    - you have to use image.centerOrigin, then set the entity's graphic
  - can't use this.scene in new constructor of an entity, have to use in added or HXP.scene
  - can't use getClass or similar scene-entity functions until the entities are added, which occurs the frame after you exectute scene.add
  - creating an entity doesn't automatically create a hitbox, and so entity.width and entity.height return 0
  
code:
		//var bd:BitmapData = new BitmapData(50, 50, true, 0xFF0000FF);
		//var image:Image = new Image(bd);
