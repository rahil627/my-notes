  - reply to http://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/430740
  - is it worth the time to use / create a game engine like FlashPunk? What are the benefits?
    - screen management, input management, collision detection, camera, 2D sprite related things such as color, events (add, remove), libraries for math (movement)



  - FIND A WAY TO TEST MONOGAME ON IOS
  - GOOGLE FARSEER PHYSICS SAMPLES RUNNING ON iOS


  - find method to draw primitives
  - draw a filled polygon (angled rectangles)
  - test primitive libraries
    - https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x-for-xna/blob/master/cocos2d-xna/CCDrawingPrimitives.cs *
    - able to draw filled polygon? If so, steal point in polygon function
    - use plain XNA to draw a triangle strip
    x/- primitive batch
        - test the version in MonoGame Samples first
          - only supports LineList and TriangleList
    - shapes library
    - something on top of XNA drawing?
    - test Farseer physics
      - test point in polygon
    - choose one and add to Mime

    - primitives:
      - plain XNA (PrimitiveDataTypes: LineList, LineStrip, TriangleList, TriangleStrip)

        - efficient drawing*
      - Farseer Physics (Box2d port)
        - can turn off simulation?
        - getting comfortable with Box2d is a good thing!
      - http://primitivebatch.codeplex.com/
      - http://shapes.codeplex.com/
        - quite advanced, drawing shapes, collision, just missing physics, perfect?
      - https://bitbucket.org/C3/2d-xna-primitives/wiki/Home
        - no polygon or rotated rectangle

Prototypy frameworks:
  - http://nuclexframework.codeplex.com/
  - http://xnaxen.codeplex.com/ - great
  - yna - good and current
  - https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x-for-xna
    - https://github.com/totallyevil/cocos2d-xna
  - MonoPunk - outdated, but simple
  - AngelXNA
  - SunBurn
  - FlixelXNA (https://github.com/StAidan/X-flixel, 
  
Examples from recent game competitions:

iOS development:
  - http://www.vimov.com/isimulate/
    - can tether device to simulator

MonoGame:
  - build troubleshooting:
    - MonoGame Framework reference from the MonoDevelop add-in does not work, reference a .dll file instead
    - set the build action of content files to "Content"
    - Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.ContentLoadException: Could not load Effects/BloomExtract asset as a non-content file!
      - You cannot use custom effect XNBs built with the VS2010 with MonoGame.

  - should add the MonoGame framework project to the solution, so when you check declarations, you can see the source code and comments
    - check out http://darkgenesis.zenithmoon.com/xna-and-beyond-the-notable-mentions/
      - has some nice prototyping libraries, like YNA

  - https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/MonoGame-Content-Processing
    - need Visual Studio 2010 (and Windows) for content processing

XNA:
  - http://blog.gneu.org/2012/04/xna-components-better-structure-and-organization/
    - describes game loop
  - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203893.aspx
    - describes the game loop
  - can't add a game collection to another game collection
    - only one level of update? No children?
      - http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/9642/using-components-in-the-xna-game-state-management-example
  - should make viewport static, or check the ScreenManager class?
  - this.Game (like World) is automagically set by GameComponent
  - this.GraphicsDevice.Viewport is like Screen in FlashPunk
    - Vector2 center = new Vector2(GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Width /2, GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Height /2);

  - should use MonoPunk as a framework when a games needs to be completed. Prototyping without it is okay.*****

  - libraries:
    - https://bitbucket.org/C3/2d-xna-primitives/wiki/Home
    - Farseer Physics* - current



MonoDevelop:
  - will be using this for both MonoGame and Unity
  - command + .
  - control + space
  - "quick fix"
  - "code generation"
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11171752/refactor-keyboard-shortcuts-in-monodevelop

C#/.NET
  - will be using this for both MonoGame and Unity

library:
  - MonoGame contains XNA, MonoTouch, Mono (.NET)

creating a new project:
  - re-reference MonoGame framework and Lindgren.Network 
    - are the references for MonoGame framework and Lindgren.Network platform dependent?
