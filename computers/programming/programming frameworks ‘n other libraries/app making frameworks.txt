cross-platform frameworks:
Xamarin
React
Ionic
Flutter

notes:
Flutter
  - dart, Google’s new stuff
  - live-reload
  - supports native and web
  - most loved framework on a survey

Xamarin
  - .net / c# world, uses native ui
  - two ways to do ui: forms library can be used for completely code-shared ui, or, ios and android specific libraries can be accessed making for more complex platform-specific ui
  - there is only ‘fast deployment’ for android devices via android studio; there is no live-reloading
  - old-school build ‘n deploy process
  - of the big 3, this was the least loved

React
  - javascript world, uses native code beneath (via React Native library)
  - popular, therefore many libraries, tutorials, support, but, likely messy, inefficient
  - live-reload (no need to build, deploy, etc.)
  - completely code shared, ‘build once, run everywhere’

Ionic
  - typescript, angular, uses cordova (aka phonegap) to port web code to devices, uses web (html, css) for ui
  - because it uses web for ui, it just can’t look good as native ui apps
  - can now be used with any javascript front-end (react, angular, vue, etc.)?
