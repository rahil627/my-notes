font
	andale mono
	bitstream vera sans mono - same as dejavu sans mono?
	consolas***** - came with visual studio 2008? size 10-11 in notepad++, the new standard, size 9 in FlashDevelop
	courier new - notepad++ default? or was it lucida console?
	dejavu sans mono***** - same as bitstream, comments are more italic than bitstream, size 10 is stretched vertically
	kooteney*** - small tabs, yet consolas look, not monospaced
	monoco - ew, mac OS default for textmate
	inconsolata - free consola-like, looks faded
	prestige elite std - similar lines strain eye
	open symbol - unique, has different symbols
	ocr a std - too console-ish
	proggysquare - looks nice!
	lucida console - 10 in notepad/notepad2, 11 in notepad++
	tahoma***** - windows default, very quick to read in studies, non-monospaced
	calibri - microsoft word's default, also easy to read, non-monospaced
	droid sans mono**** - like consolas, but a bit longer vertically, tough competition with consolas
