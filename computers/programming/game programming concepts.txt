Some of the best samples can be found in game jam games. Just check Ludum Dare for the framework you are interested in, and possibly even a game that does what you want to.

object-oriented model vs component model

    - a simple explanation

http://www.openframeworks.cc/tutorials/maths/001_vector_maths.html

moving in 2d in a non-orthoganal direction
			//get the directional vector
			var dx:Number = (target.x - this.x);
			var dy:Number = (target.y - this.y);
					
			//normalize the vector
			var magnitude:int = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
			dx = dx / magnitude;
			dy = dy / magnitude;
			
			//move at an angle
			//vx = SPEED * dx * FP.elapsed;
			//vy = SPEED * dy * FP.elapsed;
			//x += vx;
			//y += vy;
			
			other method?
			//dx = Math.sin(angle * Flash.RADIAN);
			//dy = Math.cos(angle * Flash.RADIAN);

game update
  player update
    player's children updates
      etc.
  enemy update
    enemy's children updates
      etc.
  etc.
  
  as opposed to enter_frame event? The only difference is that there is an order.

while( user doesn't exit ) {
for each frame {
  check for user input
  run AI
  resolve collisions (move bacK, remove, etc)
  draw graphics (?)
  play sounds
}
}
