My approach has changed a bit since I wrote this. I use the "add the type to the end of the variable" style most often now:

CancelButton
ClickEvent

I think this is a lot more .NET friendly than the "classic" 3-character prefix eg

btnCancel
evtClick

I've also stopped trying to distingish strings and integers. In the above example,

_CustomerName
CustomerID


I agree, I've switched to extremely short name / short scope local variables, too.

my naming conventions
MyClass
runFunction
_privateVariable or _private_variable
publicVariable or publicVariable
global/static?
btnSubmit - used for UI elements and non-obvious differences

runFunction() {
	print "I'm running already!"
}
//blank line?

use this/self when possible
