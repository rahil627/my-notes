symbols - i like to use ‘-‘ because it’s readable and one click, but ‘~’ and ‘_’ are good too
numbers - very useful because they are ordered by number!
alphabet - can use ‘z’ to put a file in the end
strange and foreign characters

**unfortunately, i used spaces in most of my filenames... :(**
  - **as long as the folder names don’t have spaces, things should be pretty easy though**

  - case sensitive
  - forbidden characters
  - generally should avoid ‘.’ (dot) and ‘/‘




the tilde ‘~’ doesn’t seem to put it at the end for me...

  - very good post
  - see forbidden list below:

The forbidden printable ASCII characters are:

Linux/Unix:
  / (forward slash)

Windows:
  < (less than)
  > (greater than)
  : (colon - sometimes works, but is actually NTFS Alternate Data Streams)
  " (double quote)
  / (forward slash)
  \ (backslash)
  | (vertical bar or pipe)
  ? (question mark)
  * (asterisk)


macOS:
: and forward slash / depending on context are not permitted (e.g. Finder supports slashes, terminal supports colons)



https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8086375/what-character-to-use-to-put-an-item-at-the-end-of-an-alphabetic-list
  - z and zz are still the best
  - Ω is good, and easy to type: option+z on mac/ios, but, might cause problems elsewhere!


windows:
windows has some symbols that are forbidden! be careful. Linux doesn’t have this restriction.

  - windows order

Windows goes by the order of the ascii table
