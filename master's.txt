To apply to a master's program, you need a very specific direction.

biotechnology?:
stumbled upon NYU POLY's biotechnology and biotechnology and entrepreneurship

new media:
1. MIT - Media Lab (media arts and sciences), abroad?
  - December 15 deadline
  - need research / purpose?
  - they pay you to be a researcher!
2. NYU - ITP
  - "ITP is a creative environment at the intersection of Art and Technology in which diversity is valued and collaboration is encouraged."
3. Parson's - Art and Technology
  - Paris campus, can spend a semester or year there!
  - toy, fashion, architecture, performance, film, etc.

others:
University of Washington - DXARTS, only PhD in the U.S.
