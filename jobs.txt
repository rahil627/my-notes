https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/08/paramedic-sydney
  - “Just as likely, an office-worker might call us, having a panic attack. They do that, office workers. All the stress, they tell us. If I worked in an office, I’d probably have a panic attack too.”
  - “But Australian paramedics are stoic types, and would rather drive themselves to hospital with a limb hanging off than go by ambulance.”
  - “In saying that, the biggest mistake any medic is likely to make is a misdiagnosis and the giving or withholding of treatment that possibly contributes to an avoidable disability or death. These mistakes can weigh on a medic’s conscience for a very long time, sometimes forever. Yet it’s universally agreed that mistakes are essential to perfecting skills. It just so happens that our mistakes can kill people. That’s why few EMTs and paramedics, or doctors and nurses for that matter, will ever admit in public to making a mistake, because questions will inevitably be asked. We’re generally very hard on ourselves anyway, without extra scrutiny. Just about every patient I fail to save will lead to a period of agonising reflection and self-examination. But I suppose that comes with the territory.”

http://emtlife.com/threads/what-material-is-on-the-australian-paramedic-test.35340/
  - very good post of English teacher working abroad wanting EMS, and is a scuba diver
  - “There is no "Paramedic exam" in Australia because Paramedics in Australia do not have a professional licensing body “
  - “Paramedic is now a Bachelors Degree.”
  - “The only courses leading to service-led authority to practice as a Paramedic in Australia are Bachelor Degrees run by a CAA accredited University, in Australia, which take a minimum of three years to complete; the only exception to this is the ASNSW as above.”
  - “A bunch of private industry dreamers have set up a little play outfit called AREMT but don't go near them with a thirty food yard pole; they're a club for hacks and wannabees that the real, proper state run Ambulance Services laugh at. Once AHPRA register Paramedics these delusionists will have to go back to using their true, proper title of first aiders because it will become illegal to call yourself a Paramedic without AHPRA registration which will require the Degree or higher (or for those who qualified prior to about 2002 the Dip Para Sci) otherwise they will be shut down and prosecuted.”
  - *****“In short the one and only way to become a Paramedic in Australia is to hold a Bachelors Degree in Paramedic Science from a CAA accredited university; except in New South Wales where the Dip Para Sci is still taught but both take three years and the latter takes employment with the Ambulance Service of New South Wales which getting is as rare as hens teeth mate.”

Remember:
Only work at a great company, one I'm very interested in, small size, one who's people or products I feel are valueable
Don't choose something you know how to do, explore. Try something new.
Never comprimise. Don't take a job around the thing you want to do. 
Find or concieve a project that I am interested it, then do it. It's as simple as that

Jobs that I currently find cool:
media companies, digital media
video game designer/developer
film director, cinematographer
independent website designer
independent photographer, for events, products, people, anything
