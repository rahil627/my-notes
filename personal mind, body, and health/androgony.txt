hmmm... maybe I need an androgynous name:
Rahil
Sahil
Sahel
Rachel
Rakel

the ‘ra’ is masculine. the second syllable should be feminine.

**Raha**
  - ending in a sounds feminine, as in Neha, Nisha, etc.
  - most androgynous sounding!
Rala
Rata
**Rahala**
  - not bad!
Rahila
Raheela
  - sounds like Shila (Sheela) and Sheetal!
Rahital (Raheetal)
**Ratal**
**Rahal**
  - best one so far...

Raha vs Rahal
  - the cut-off ending of Rahal makes it less feminine, thus, Raha sounds better when calling it

Rahali (Rahalee)
  - i ending is also quite feminine, as in Nirali

Rahi
  - n
