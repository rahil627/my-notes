soon after seeing those videos, I must have questioned myself. In two night settings, I did a tiny bit of research into the words: labels on Wikipedia. Turns out, I’m just non-binary.

I asked Magi the melee player; He pointed me toward some Reddit titled egg, a metaphor for transvestites coming out. After a bit of wandering on various Reddit boards (androgyny, etc.), I found that non-binary / a-gender is what fits me best.

androgyny seems to be a combination of male and female cultures. Non-binary is not giving a fuck about either. On the Reddit boards for androgyny, there’s a bunch of people posting selfies trying to achieve some sort of **androgyny ideal**, which is to hhave the appearance of neither, **an ambiguous look**.

hmmm... maybe I need an androgynous name:
Rahil
Sahil
Sahel
Rachel
Rakel

the βraβ is masculine. the second syllable should be feminine.

**Raha**
  - ending in a sounds feminine, as in Neha, Nisha, etc.
  - most androgynous sounding!
Rala
Rata
**Rahala**
  - not bad!
Rahila
Raheela
  - sounds like Shila (Sheela) and Sheetal!
Rahital (Raheetal)
**Ratal**
**Rahal**
  - best one so far...

Raha vs Rahal
  - the cut-off ending of Rahal makes it less feminine, thus, Raha sounds better when calling it

Rahali (Rahalee)
  - i ending is also quite feminine, as in Nirali

Rahi
  - n
