notes from Williamsburg Clinic:
insect precautions:
mosquitos are attracted to heat, c02, sweat, and some scented products (because they heat up on the skin).
spray clothes (both sides) with 25-35% deet, especially around cuffs and collars, then exposed skin (except face). Rub some on hand, then rub around neck and back of ears.

Dengue for daytime. Malaria, Yellow Fever, and Japanese Encephalitus from dusk to dawn.

for Malaria see anti-malarials.txt

So, reapply before dusk.

Can treat clothes with Permethrin, especially things you don’t often wash, like hats and jackets.

Food:
avoid eating salads. It is really difficult to wash fruits and vegetables of poop. And even if it’s washed, it is washed with tap water. Can eat those fruits and vegetables that can be peeled.

in general just eat hot, steamy foods.

avoid ice (including frozen desserts).

brush with bottled water

carbonated water is more difficult to fake with tap water. Double wrapped packaged of bottled water, like in 6-packs also are more difficult to fake.

Traveler’s Diarrhea:
For mild diarrhea:
Start with Pepto-bismal tablets, then use antibiotic (every 6-8 hours or whatever directions are)

For severe diarrhea:
Considered 2-3 poops in a 2 hour period, especially with a fever described as clammy
Azithromycin is recommended for India and Thailand. Cipro for all other countries.



Take Immodium AD two hours after Azithromycin.

conclusion:
- work exchanges (and likely all low level work) are not satisfying as they lack responsibility and don't require much intelligence
  - or I am unable to extract value in such social situations. I need space and time to think. I can only work in a highly social environment for a few hours a day.

traveler's diarrhea:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/travelersdiarrhea_g.htm
  - great tips to handle traveler's diarrhea, see the treatment section
  - suggests antibiotics for 3-5 days, currently, fluoroquinolones. Commonly 500mg of ciprofloxacin twice a day or 400mg of norfloxacin twice a day. Bismuth subsalicylate also may be used as treatment, 1 fluid ounce or 2 262mg tablets every 30 minutes for pup to eight doses in a 24 hour period.
  - Bismuth subsalicylate can be used for preventative measures, 4 times daily, but should not exceed 3 weeks.
  - conclusion: Take bismuth subsalicylate if you're going to eat something bad. Take bismuth subsalicylate during the first few days of sickness. Take antibiotics when you are really sick, on the third day or later, and check current effective antibiotics in case of resistant areas. Don't take anti motility agents (loperamide) if you have have a fever or bloody stools.

    - good list of things to pack for hostels

bags:

laptop backpack
- must have laptop compartment
- should fit camera during flights
- small profile
- comfortable, stable
- ~20L

carry-on bag that will be checked-in
- durable
- within minimum carry on size bag dimension limits
- wheels and telescopic handle
- good standard handles

north face surge or Kelty Redwing Backpack
  - too large for a personal item. It's carry-on size.

after going to local stores:
Osprey Escapist 20 and The North Face Recon looked like a good size, so Surge should be perfect. Can choose size for Surge II. TNF Black/Triumph Green/Blue.
20 x 13.5 x 9.5

flight booking:

wego?

cost estimation:
$1000 x 2, to and from US
$300 x 5, flights within Asia
$3500 + local transporation, food (sometimes), events (if city)
conclusion, much cheaper than living in any American city!









the ultimate choice is this:
work independently, creating my own projects, entering contests, and later grants, funding, etc.
or, seek a media organization or company to work with

how to find?
  - try couchsurfing
    - Hong Kong
    - http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=7DSNA2K&from_search&search_ranking_hosts=1
      - general art
    - http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=6G6Q0AA&from_search&search_ranking_hosts=2
      - apple device developer, also hacks other things!
    - http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=T1QFEKF&from_search&search_ranking_hosts=10

    - ask if possible without language in other countries
    - Tokyo
      - http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=HA5NMY5&from_search&search_ranking_locals=1
  - advance google search keywords
    - independent film
    - openframeworks
    
    
    
   
  
todo:
  - 1. figure out places to live in
    - 1 year East Asia travel
    - Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Fukuoka)
    - China (Hong Kong, Taipei)
    - Korea (Seoul)
    - one south east
    - one WWOOF
      - would be rural, so choose a geographically unique area such as a mountain or island
      - make sure there's wifi
    - one sustainable development
      - Indonesia, limited to 4 weeks
    - end in India
    - can continue later for Western Europe travel
  - 2. figure out how to stay there (house sitting, workaway, couchsurf, WWOOF, etc.)
    - may determine the city
    
  - 3. what kind of work if workaway?
    - teaching
    - farming
    - other primitive skills
  
  - *. could figure out how stay in Japan first, buy a ticket, then figure out the rest
    - or is it better to buy all of the tickets at once?
    
  - end in India
  
  - ultimately NY
    - be as prolific as possible
    - network
    - reconnect with Babycastles and Zack

  
Work exchange search:
  Tokyo
    - it seems part-time jobs rarely sponsor work visas, the best bet is to workaway for accomodation, food, and perhaps a little money
