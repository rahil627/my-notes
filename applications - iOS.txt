main:
can check “purchase” (download) history in App Store
  - it includes free apps
  - can hide downloaded apps
    - not sure if you can un-hide them if you hide them by accident
      - this is a problem, because there is a bug on iOS, where hiding a app, hid the one below it

old:
WriteBox
  - abandoned, made by a Japanese person
    - I messaged him on Twitter, but I don’t think he ever responded
  - it had a cool web version of the app, so it could be used on any computer without installing it, including the Dropbox file manager

PlainText [2]
  - to replace WriteBox, though, I loved WriteBox more. PlainText just had uglier fonts, and just somehow wasn’t as beautifully minimal as WriteBox

from digital workflows.txt:
station?
Notion for iOS - todos, wikis, collaborative
Breaker - social podcast app
Hoodmaps
unroll.me - to clean identity from the internet, site permissions, etc.
