rear bag:
attach this behind the seat, on the rear rails. use metal clamps and/or plastic zip ties to clamp the basket’s frame’s bottom to the rear rails. or: clamp a steel plate and glue the bottom of the entire basket to it.
  - **this is the easiest one to attach**
a crate would work, as a cheap and sturdy solution
a square crate or a circular basket can be better, as it wouldn’t add more width to the cycle, allowing one to go through tighter areas
a natural basket with a metal frame is best, providing a strong attachment point


**new, simpler saddle-bag tying design**:
just attach pegs to the frame where the front and rear saddle-bags should be. then, hang the bags on the pegs. the pegs should have hooks or a carabiner-like locking system (similar to the attachment points provided on under-bone cycles) 


fuel tank saddle-bags:
rattan or steel material, like my front basket on my cub, or anything that allows *a lot* of air through

tying methods:
somehow attach it directly to the frame, with a steel clamp and a steel pole

tie cords to the steel frame of the cycle, crossing the fuel tank, providing some places to attach things to. Then, use another cord to attach the bag to the main cord. Add a carabiner to make attaching and detaching more convenient.
  - this way allows things to hang, swing, naturally


rear saddle-bags:
attach bags to the provided steel attachment points below the seat or to the seat rail
  - these bags cannot swing in-side, or else it will contact the tire. therefore, panniers work well. to attach any anything else, the attachment joint shouldn’t allow the bags to swing. or: a hard panel can be inserted between the cycle and the bag.
  - the bags should fit behind the rear-passenger’s legs


hard panel design:
get a sheet of hard material: hard plastics (a plastic folder would work well!), aluminum, steel. then, punch a hole in the area where it should be attached. attach with a screw and large washers.


fuel tank bag:
would need to add plastic between the bag and fuel tank, to prevent fuel touching the bag. could get a pannier-style bag which have hard-side, placing the bag hard-side down
  - **this is the most difficult one to get right**, yet, possibly the most convenient
