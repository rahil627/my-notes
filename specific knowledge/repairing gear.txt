  - You do not need a glue dot for sealing that sleeping pad. A Tear Aid patch is all you need. I have an original Neoair that I used a Type-A patch on and it is still holding up great. Just make sure to clean the surface thoroughly before patching.
  - “If you have cuben tape on hand, it works wonders too. Ensure you have a clean surface and apply pressure with the back of a spoon to force the glue into the fabric.”
