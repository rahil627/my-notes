phones

the standard VoIPs:
Skype
Google Voice
  - i moved my US carrier phone number here before leaving the States

“secondary phone” apps:
Burner
  - originally used to make temporary numbers
  - now the most popular app (3/2020), so they now support permanent numbers
  - i tried on iOS, and to begin using it, it requires a carrier phone number
Telos
  - currently unavailable on the iOS app store?
