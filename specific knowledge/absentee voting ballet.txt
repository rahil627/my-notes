an email asking about absentee ballot

Hello!
Thank you for your fast response!  I will process your application and your ballot for the May local election will be mailed tomorrow.
Unfortunately, you do have to submit an application for each election.  For your convenience, I have attached the Virginia Absentee Ballot application so you may use it for future elections.  If you would like, you can submit your applications up to a year in advance of the elections.  We are having a June 12, 2012 Primary and the November 6, 2012 General election this year.  You can also return the application by mail, fax or e-mail.  Here is our information:

Chesapeake, VA 23322
Fax: (757) 547-5402
E-mail: to me :) (ehibnerreavis@cityofchesapeake.net)
Thank you for your fast response!
