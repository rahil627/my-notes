notes:
screen problem on new macbook pros:
I am in need of a new MBP. I do development (Ruby/Rails) on my mid 2009 13" MPB running Mavericks, and I find it is getting old enough that I'm getting some lag when I'm running DB and web server, Rubymine, browsers, etc. all at once. I would buy the latest 13" MBP today, as I don't need more than the 8GB/256GB setup. My issue is the screen itself. I LOVE the glossy screens, but I went to the Apple Store and touched the screen on a new RMPB. The LCD distorted as it flexed. Apparently these are plastic screens? A while back I was looking at a friend's Macbook Air. I didn't realize the screens were plastic, no glass like my older MPB. I get why they are using plastic, but it seemed like he had to use a screen protector on his MBA because oil from the tips of his fingers would collect on the keys, and the keys would touch the screen when it was closed. This happened on my old Pismo Powerbook and my 12" powerbook. The oil actually attacks the plastic and mars it permanently.

Samsung doesn’t have burn-in problem, slightly worse colors
old LG has burn-in problem
new LP154WT1-SJA2 doesn’t have burn-in problem
all have dead pixel problems
https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4034848
  - huge thread on burn-in problem

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6068947
  - finger oil destroyed screen?
  - another person said he carried it in a neoprene case, not a hard case, and did not use a screen protector, Apple said it was excessive pressure. I will really need a hard case to use this laptop, or, a glass laptop.
  - so, don’t use alcohol, and get a screen protector

it’s glossy, but less glare than old macbook retinas, and non-retinas
non-retinas are anti-glare
can buy an anti-glare screen protector

Yes, it is a problem of all retina macbook pros before 2012 upgrade

Macbook 13” never had matte option, only 15” and 17” did.

  - picture of non-retina, retina, matte
  - matte is far less pretty, an anti-glare screen protector may look the same

should buy Anker screen protectors for all devices:
