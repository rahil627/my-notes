Others? Are any of the new Audeze iSine series semi-open?”

Ostry KC06A, old Titan1 contender, closed

**CCA C10**
  - considered a top chinese earphone

Knowledge Zenith:
https://knowledgezenith.com/collections/all
  - ED series has a much smaller casing than the rest (ES, ZS...)

https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/kz-zsn-knowledge-zenith.23357/reviews
  - somebody testes certain year’s line of headphones by KZ in the reviews, providing comparisons to the ZSN Pro

https://www.headphonesty.com/2019/10/review-kz-zsx/
  - not only reviews the ZSX, but also provides a categorization of all the models

https://www.head-fi.org/search/3197328/?q=kz+zs10+zsn+pro+as&o=relevance
  - search thr massive thread for favorites:
  - **edr1, e9, zsn pro, zs10 pro, cca c10**

AS series;
**AS10**
  - $60 on Amazon, 1400b on Lazada
  - “worth the 3x cost”

ZS series:
**ZSX**
  - $60 on Amazon
  - seems like ZS10, but with a bit more clarity / airy sound
**ZS10 Pro**
  - $60 on Amazon, **800b-1000b** on Lazada
  - considered one of best of the ZS series, well-rounded
  - solid 4.7 rating reviews on Amazon
  - has bass
  - “plasticy and look like ES4 but **even more bulky**. I had trouble keeping them in place in my ears sometimes. Sound-wise they are actually very similar sounding to great ZSN. We have good bass control, decent amount of mids, but this time **highs are not that overwhelming right out of the box**. So without using any EQ these are the most neutral sounding of them all. **However, I do feel that ZSN have the slight advantage in overall liveliness.** When mentioned EQ is applied to solve theirs overly forward highs, I keep preferring them to ZS10”
 ZS10
   - balanced, though not flat
   - compared to the Pro version, these are bulkier, plastic back, the connector fits loosely as there is no cable reinforcement...

**ZSN Pro X**
  - “Small upgrade from the non X version, **seems treble less shrill. Better cord.**”
ZSN Pro
  - $20 on Amazon, 300-400b on Lazada
  - for $20, it’s a steal
  - treble too sharp
  - hissing sound
  - wider sound-stage than ZSN, metal back
  - more open / wider sound-stage than ES4
  - more separated sounds, with clear distinction between frequencies
  - more detailed sounds in all frequencies
  - low bass not as highlighted
  - “about 75% as good for half the cost [of ZS10, AS10]
**ZSN**
  - “Go with the ZSN. These [Pro’s] hype up the bass way too much and the highs get even more harsh and crispy than the ZSN - none of this in a good way.”

ZS7
  - better low-end than ZS10, but just not ad balanced

ZS6 (ZS5...)
  - “very clear and clean sounding pair of earphones with really good separation. I feel that they pull ahead slightly in-front of ZS10 in that regard. Their overall balance however is again similar to ZSA – **mids are too thin and highs are too bright**. Playing with EQ I could fix some of that but I still couldn’t make vocals sound full and juicy. While I respect theirs much better separation and organization compared to ZSA – no vocal or instrument in real world sounds this thin and dry and that’s all I have to say about that.“

ZSA
  - ...somewhat different. They come in **smaller size** and in metal finish that I like. Soundwise, the overall clarity, separation and soundstage are comparable to ES4. Clarity is quite good for the price but they can still get overwhelmed by busy tracks. The frequency balance is a bit different, the bass is deep and present but it’s not overwhelming in any way. The lack of midrange strikes again and vocals lack juice and fluidity. **Highs are even more pronounced making these very bright and harsh** sounding to my ear. If you heard ZS5, these have very similar balance, the one I don’t particularly like. Nothing sounds like this in the real world, people are not hissing snakes so they shouldn’t sound like that. And if I use EQ to lower highs I can get rid of that brightness but mids and vocals still sound kind of lifeless, dry and tiny. I have to say that I didn’t really enjoy listening to my music through them.

ES4
  - narrower sound-stage, in which sounds are clumped closer together
  - mids are meh
  - maybe more bass than the ZSN

ZST
  - basically replaced by the ZSN
  - many say this was the worst one

  - first review is great, covering much of ZS
  - KZ ZST ($18) - crystal clear highs and centered mids for a bass oriented IEM
    **KZ ZS3** ($18) - organic lifelike presentation
    **KZ ED9** ($14) tied with **KZ HDS3** ($6) - open-backeded & out-of-head presentation
