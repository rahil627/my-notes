FUCK FILM EQUIPMENT. ALL YOU NEED IS YOUR IPHONE...and audio.

no need with awesome camcorder:
nee war? spider rig (3.3lb) vs gorilla pod (13.8 ounces, + stick) vs monopod (0.64 lbs*) vs neewar steadicam* - try the steadicam at home

sound:
  - some directional microphone
    - videomic pro - 3.5mm cable (can go directly into camcorder), 3oz!!!!, small size, can still attach to a boom pole (monopod)
    - ntg-2 (would need h4n connected? maybe could get xlr to 3.55mm adapter), $200 form eBay
    - me66
    - size vs quality + XLR input (xlr cords transmit audio better, but perhaps could just convert using adapter?), 
    - mke600
    - Takstar - $40, almost videomic pro! 1 pound!?, possibly smallest form factor
  - other sound gear?
    - stereo + shotgun is easier to set up on the go than wireless lavaliere! Think about documentary filmmaking man!
    - having a shogun on the camera is stupid because it means you would have to keep the audio source in the center of the camera view. You would need an audio guy holding the mic out of the view of the camera and pointing it at the desired audio source
    - just use the h4n for better stereo, mount it on camera, take it off and put it on a boom mic (gorilla pod or any kind of pole i find along the way, maybe get pnc pipe to screw adapter), or attach a mic
    - yep video mic pro and a long 3.5mm cable :)

conclusion:
  - Rode video mic pro

monopod:
Manfrotto monopod compact new series advanced (MMCOMPACTADV-BK)* - .75lb, 6lb load, aluminum with parts, has a ‘quick wheel’ for the tripod screw, which kinda replaces the need for a quick release
Manfrotto monopod compact new series - .64lb, 3lb load, same as old with a new grip, all black
manfrotto monopod compact - .64lb, 3lb load, all black
Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod (.8lb) 6lb load

conclusion: bought the compact new series advanced, but really don’t need it with the camcorder

video heads:
Manfrotto MKC3-H01 Compact Photo-Movie Kit! — has a head I may want

fluid head (maybe can screw off the handle?):
Velbon PH-368 Vel-Flo 9 Mini-Pro - 1.7 pound, cheap 501, large, <$30

128rc - 2lb, basic
701* - standard small, 1.8lb*
Manfrotto 700RC2 - 1.14lb*, about same size at 701, just less bulk and features
501 - standard large
? - grip head
327RC2 - 1.3lb

391RC2 - 3 way, 1.5lb, short handle, only pan, tilting is manually adjustable

Manfrotto 234RC - tilt head

conclusion: decided not to buy it when I found out how awesome the stabilization of camcorder is

sell GH-2?
  - because the OIS is still nowhere near as good as camcorders
  - there are no good OIS lens with low f/stop
  - OM-D would have been a much better purchase because it has in body image stabilization, even if it only works with electrical lens
  - i would have to spend money on equipment, and lug it around with me

remember: ETC mode covers 2.6x of each lens, so 25 -> 25 * 2 * 2.6 = 130


what i want to do:
shoot a music video Vincent Moon style
  - external audio recorder
  - omnidirectional mic for bands
    - place somewhere if not moving
    - place on camera if moving
  - wired lapel mic for a single moving actor
  - wireless lapel mics  for multiple moving actors (in a non-staged environment)
  - lapel or shotgun for interviews (lapel requires setup)
  - omnidirectional mic for ambient
shoot experimental film
  - omnidirectional mic for most
staged film
  - shotgun mic with a boom stick

how is Department of Eagles recorded as they walk through Chinatown?
  - i believe each performer has a wireless lapel mic. Both of the mics connect to a portable digital audio recorder. There is also a stereo mic on the camera, also connected to the recorder. All 3 play in sync. How come the lapel mics don't generate wind noise?

do I need a camcorder?
  - zoom
  - tilt screen
  - manual focus and exposure (as opposed to tap)
  - microphone mount

  also over GH-2:
  - better stabilization

conclusion:
Only need audio for now (ship to Malaysia). Order camcorder later (ship home, black friday sales). Learn to record audio well, and shoot well first. Can try iPhone filming apps again to control exposure and focus.


chinese LED lights? lol

http://www.dvxuser.com/V6/showthread.php?202177-DVX100-VS-Canon-T2i-(for-video) ******

Canon EOS
rebel t3
rebel t3i/600D* - missing features (manual Kelvin control, intermediate ISO, etc) compared to 60d , single contrast detection autofocus instead of 9 point, no 'live' aperture control during movie?, 3x crop*, manual audio controls
60D** - built-in audio controls, headphone jack, more controls to external microphone (meter), bigger/brighter viewfinder, level meter, 5.3 fps vs 3.4 fps, 1/8000 shutter speed vs 1/4000 shutter speed, 3x larger battery, larger body
7D - 8fps, better viewfinder, 19 point autofocus, better body and shutter
5D

Panasonic
Lumix DMC-GH2** (mirrorless) - can be hacked for 24p video and better zoom, has better quality video than 5D due to better aliasing, also less rolling shutter, has automatic gain control on the microphone that cannot be disabled (sucks), lowest mic setting is too high, live HDMI out, stereo mic, better audio than cannon (+10db) similar to HMC150, manual audio with live meters, has autofocus, lesser build quality, lesser design (touch screen vs cannon buttons), has live view while taking video
Lumix DMC-G3 (mirrorless) - no manual controls

Nikon
x/D3100
x/D5100 - has autofocus but lacks manual control(ONLY Aperture and NO ISO, NO shutter control!) in video, better picture quality
D90
7000D

Sony
A55
Alpha SLT-A65V* - has phase detection AF, lacks manual exposure control, EVF, on par with canon 600D
x/NEX-5 (mirrorless) - APS-C sensor, no hotshoe, no external microphone attachment, no manual controls?
NEX-7 (mirrorless)

Pentax K-5 -No 'live' aperture control during movie shooting, no AF, 




conclusion:
rebel 600D (t3i), $670, with lens kit
60D, $900, if it's only a few more bucks, invest in canon lens, then buy a better camera for video
SLT series for the autofocus
GH-2, $900, buy canon lens adaptor and canon lens kit?

for autofocus, fast panning, documentary style long shooting:

camcorders:

JVC
GZ-HD7 - $800, 3CCD, manual controls, mic input, focus ring, the issue is the MPEG-2 compression
GZ-HD6

Panasonic
TM90* - $500, no fan, wide angle lens, longer zoom
HDC-TM900* - $600, fan noise, no true 24p
HDC-HS900 - hard drive
HDC-SD100
AG-HMC40 - $1700, cheapest professional camcorder, not great in low light due to 1/4" sensor
AG-HMC150 - $2800, 1/3" sensor, able to zoom with a fixed F-Stop when using GAIN, larger size camera body with separate physical controls, CCD imager so that everything I shoot will be sharp all the time, prefer the overall look of the images that the HMC-150 produces

Canon Vixia
HF M41* (M40, M400) - $700, new sensor, like the G10, lacks manual rings for focus and aperture; instead it's all on the touch screen, no true 24p
HF G10 - new sensor, better lends than M41, manual rings, 24p
XH A1S - $2700, miniDV
XL H1A - a lot

http://www.camcorderinfo.com/News/CamcorderInfo-2011-Select-Awards.htm
http://www.camcorderinfo.com/Buying-Guides/Amateur-Filmmakers.htm

no autofocus, alias problem, rolling shutter problem, makes the canon seem pretty bad for video


later conclusion:
buy a camcorder. It's an all-in-one indepenent filmmaker package. For the low depth of field, b-rolls, and generally more lush shots, I can buy a Canon Rebel later. Looks crappy though. =(

$600 TM900
$670 Rebel t3i with $20 lens
$900 60D, without lens

$900 GH-2 with 14-42mm lens, $300 14-140 lens or 20mm lens

HF G10 - $1200
HMC40 - $1000-1300 used

later later conclusion:
a pro film camera such as the HMC40 has everything I want, but should I just get a used HMC40 or start with a TM900? Ask Zack, then decide.

later later later conclusion:
Still will ask Zack, but leaning toward a more expensive film camera. I'm in it for film, not photography.

Film cameras:
TM900 - a steal at $600
G10 - how much better is this over the TM900 other than low light? prosumer, full manual controls
GH-2 - meh
craigslist a real film camera with accessories*** - $1000-$2000
DVX100B - $600-800, http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/pho?query=DVX100b&srchType=A&minAsk=&maxAsk=

last conclusion:
think if an idea for a film first, Tongal? Then buy the camera accordingly.

Since I'm going to SF and don't want too much baggage, I'm going to get a Canon DSLR to get started, and buy a HMC40 or equivalent when I get to SF. This way I can get started in film, and still retain a nice camera if I ever want shallow DOF shots.

need constant aperture to zoom while shooting, more expensive

Tamron > Signma and Tokina for 1/2 to 1/3 price of camera manufacturer
get EF, not EF-S
get full frame, not digital compact
manual focus

Some good advice here but truth is one lens will never do everything you want. If you don't mind used and are willing to work with manual sometimes(video is mainly manual anyway) I would pick up 4 lenses. The Tamron 17-50 used on Amazon $360, a Nikon Nikkor AI 50mm 1.4 used on Adorama $70 or Canon EF 50mm 1.8 $99, used Nikon Nikkor 85mm 1.8 $139 KEH.com and finally a 14mm 2.8 Rokinon from buydig.com $259. Grab some Fotodiox Nikon to EF adapter mounts for $13 on Amazon and you should be shooting like a pro for $800. Enjoy

17-50 is good enough for 90% of shooting needs in good light and 17mm is often wide enough.

GH2 with 14-140 lens? $700 used, $300 pancake lens

Canon 60D + EF 24-70mm L + Tonika 11-16 + EF 50mm 1.4
Panasonic GH2 + 14-140mm kit lens + 20mm 1.7 Pancake + Panasonic 7-14mm 4.0
HMC-150/151
JVC HM100?

aps-c vs micro four thirds?

But my GH2 kit with 20mm Pancake & FD Prime(35,50,85)
cost $1700. I needed compact & high IQ(travel films are my thing anyway).... ;-)

1. TM900
2. Canon 60d or GH2
3. Real video camera

http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/camcorders/tm700.shtml

After going to store:
TM900 felt better than the other camcorders.
Camcorders are tiny and have extremely limited options. HMC-40 has a handle and barely a few more options than the camcorder. HMC-150 seems perfect.
GH2 also seems ideal.

GH2 it is. No doubt better than 60D for video. Now is the time. Can upgrade to GH3 body later! Or even a AF100. *Drool*.

Panasonic GH2 + 14-140mm kit lens + 20mm 1.7 Pancake + Panasonic 7-14mm 4.0 ?

So... If you want to go primes my current personal suggestion is:
14mm F2.5 Panasonic Pancake
[ 14mm Samyang F2.8 Pentax ($380) moved to reserve to fact that it is very good and very sharp, but generally require video processing due some distortion present. ]
28mm Vivitar F2.0 28x FD ($100),
50mm SMC-M 1.7 Pentax ($60) or 50mm Canon F1.4 ($70),
85mm Samyang F1.4 Pentax ($270).

kit lens
14-140mm AF IS, but slow

primes
Voigtlander 25mm F0.95mm.
14mm f2.5 pancake
20mm f1.7 pancake - has AF, popular

zooms
Olympus Zuiko 14-35mm
Olmypus Zuiko 35-100mm
Lumix 7-14mm f4
Tokina 11-14mm f2.8 for Nikon
Tokina 11-16mm F2.8 in Nikon mount ($600)
Tamron 17-50mm F2.8 in Pentax or Nikon mounts ($400). Note that you need adapters with ability to control aperture for zooms!

prime

m43 lenses
Olympus Zuiko

old lenses
Olympus OM
Pentax PK
Nikon F lenses, Nikkor Ai
Canon FD lens - 85mm, less than that is usually too shallow, get that canon look
Minolta MD
Zeiss Contax

If you don't want to be stuck in micro 4/3 then I would exclude Canon FD and Minolta MD mounts. I would rather look for M42, Olympus OM, Pentax PK, Nikon, Contax Yashica etc. lens mounts.

buy old becuase new features like autofocus won't work, get old lens with manual aperture and focus


Olympus OM Zuiko 28mm f3.5 $50-$80 It's not just good for the price, it's good for ANY price. This lens is sick
Pentax SMC 50mm f1.4 $100-$150 Fast, razor sharp, near as good as a 50mm gets. Period.
Canon 85mm f1.8 $300-$400 Yep, not an alternate... This thing should be called an L lens. They're incredible, cheap, fast and way-overlooked.

wide: Olympic zuiko 14 - 42 for $120
normal: kiron 28mm f2.0 for $100
telephoto: Minolta 50mm f1.7 for $50 

Wideangle (24-28mm range)
Normal (40-50mm range) -> I think the Panasonic 20mm/F1.7 is the one to get here... small, light sensitive, sharp
Telephoto (100mm range)
Extreme tele (200mm range)

12mm (24mm in 35mm terms)
25mm (50mm in 35mm terms)
42mm (85mm in 35mm terms)
50mm (100mm in 35mm terms)

ND filter?

http://www.dvxuser.com/V6/showthread.php?244241-What-do-5D-Mark-II-users-think-about-the-GH2

<$600 - TM900
$600-1400 - GH2
$1400-$3000 - 5D Mark II
>$3000 - real film cameras

14mm - faster AF (.20), silent AF, f/2.5
20mm  - f/1.7, normal range, slow AF (.44)
25mm - f/1.4, normal range, no AF

leaning toward 20mm, always use external mic to avoid the noise, and use AF lock when possible
