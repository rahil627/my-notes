sleeping bag:
aim for a quilt, three season, ultralight (because you’re likely going to be in warm climates), yet 20F for versatility
  - “You can use the bag as a flat blanket on warm nights, wrap it around your body as a jacket for around camp, or close up the bottom of the bag when the temperatures drop. Quilts are the most versatile type of sleeping bag and are by far the best type of bag for backpacking in a wide range of climates”

want: 3 season, light
- outdoorslab
  - x/vireo doesn’t have a zipper, I would like to use it as a quilt to sit on
  - x/z-packs is mummy style with zipper but no hood
  - katabatic palisades is quilt no hood*
  - nunatek arc - $350
  - enlightened revelation - quilt, customizable, starting at $250* - ordered this, regular length, slim width, with hyperdry, standard 10D inside and out

http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-sleeping-bags/
  - also see missourihowell, and outdoor labs
  - should try to ebay for one
  - Sea To Summit Spark Sp II Review - cheap, 1lb, compressible*
  - REI Radiant - $200, 2.6lb, 6.3L compressed
  - Kelty Cosmic Down 20 - $100, 2.5lb

conclusion:
thewirecutter only includes popular brands. I went with the Revelation mostly because it doubles as a quilt.

water purifier:
  - life straw vs steripen ultra (usb charge!)

interesting:
  - usb solar charger - https://www.suntactics.com/product/usb-solar-charger-5/



full size multi-tools:
  - new wave - has saw and serrated knife, but also has two kinds of files that I don’t need, and is currently expensive
  - skeleton - simple 9-tool, has combo knife, but cheaper kind
  - skeleton cx* - same as above excepts with straight blade, better built, and a few additions, and it’s partly black!
  - MUT, MUT EOD - heavy duty version of skeletool, but it has some useless gun-related tools
  - conclusion: chose skeletool cx, because of stronger blade I might not need the serrated part, and because it’s partly black. Also bought a bit kit and bit extender with it.



electricity:
set of travel adapters (or not, can buy at each country)?
  - http://www.amazon.com/Ceptics-GP-5PK-International-Worldwide-Adapter/dp/B00E7P7UHK/ref=pd_cp_e_3

accel travel charger (winner of wire cutter):
  - i believe I only ever need one outlet: for my macbook

a single outlet surge protector with two usbs, with sufficient power
  - REI OREI Mate - looks great, in case I also need all input
  - Monoprice compact cube 2, dimensions are a little larger

double usb charger (US), 10w
  - http://www.amazon.com/New-Trent-NT90C-high-speed-Smartphones/dp/B009RXU59C/ref=sr_1_16?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1412726673&sr=1-16&keywords=usb+travel+adapter

single outlet surge protector
  - x/Belkin with one usb - looks quite large, might as well keep the 3 usb
  - could not find a good product

conclusion:
OREI M8 and some extra fuses
