just trying to buy some portable headphones at the Osaka airport...

thereâ€™s one store that sells products from two companies: Sony and Audio Technica. The cool thing is that they have all sorts of Asia-only models.

clip-ons:
only once choice:
ATH-EQ300M

a great pop clip-ons review:

  - Sony uses a spring to fit, has a retractable cable, and, the signature flat Sony sound. Otherwise: AT has better highs (at the cost of worse lows), Koss as a V-shape, and the Phillips have muddy bass. So, only the Phillips have a fault; the rest is choice.

cans:
Sony ZX series
  - ZX110, etc.
Audio Technica steeet monitoring series
  - S100

IEMs:
the standards:
Sony EX15...
Audio Technica CK...
