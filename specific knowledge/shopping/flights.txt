# flights
## 3/2020
Osaka to Chiang Mai
  - ~$126 (12600JPY) + bag cost
Osaka to Bangkok (DMK)
  - ~$100 (11000JPY) + bag cost
  - note: a LCC airport out-side of Bangkok, but not BKK
  - Air Asia
    - probably the best LCC for SE Asia, long-standing, battle-hardened (from surviving business *and* terrible Asian tourists), full of promos and promo prices. The down-side of this is that the prices flucuate, every-day.
  - Nok Air
    - great national budget airline for Thailand. Very reasonable checked-in baggage prices. Reviews are on par with AirAsia, if not warmer, with more heart (water and peanuts provided!).
    - international flight isn’t competitive at the moment
  - NokScoot (under Scoot)
    - pretty bad reviews, 3.0 on trip advisor. Not a scam, but as low as I’d go.
    - the prices seem a lot more stable than AirAsia, which is nice. For example, it’s $70 or $110 all month. The $70 fare is also much cheaper than anything I’ve seen from AirAsia. The baggage price is on par with AirAsia.
  - Thai Lion Air
    - terrible reviews!, many say they scam you by claiming that you didn’t purchase bags. Their baggage cost is nice as they calculate per kilogram. Don’t even bother though; NokScoot offers the same price, with a much better reputation.
  - Thai Airways
    - insanely expensive

The biggest problem is the checked-in baggage, which can cost between $15-$50 for international flights. Otherwise, all have quite cheap flights, at around $100 to $150 fo Osaka to DMK or Osaka to Chaing Mai.

Like Taiwan, it’s best to just get into the country, then, take the slow trains, easing into the country. Also, DMK airport has a train station! So, it’s best to just go there then take the train (if the place is accessible by train).

Still, national flights are extremely cheap, at just $30 with Nok Air, with reasonable check-in baggage prices.

# East Asia trip flights
todo:
don't worry about prices of flights so much. The difference is a few days of living in a city (~$20+/day).
CouchSurf in each country. Find great people to surf with. Try to give them something, instead of consuming everything. Enjoy our time together. Teach. Learn. Share.

pack smart

see todo in each city

route:
AMD - HKG - ICN - NRT or Osaka or ferry to Fukuoka - TPE
Cambodia would be an extra $265 dollars
Manila can be done between Hong Kong and South Korea, or possibly from anywhere in East Asia. There's a $60 flight from Taiwan.
Bangkok would be the same price, but have to book early
Meh, I don't feel like traveling now, I feel like working! Save the Philippines for later.
