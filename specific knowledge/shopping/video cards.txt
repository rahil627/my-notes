For video cards the de facto interface is still PCI-e and our power supply is still good enough to handle anything. We have PCI-e v1.1, but it's compatible with 2.0, and you won't hit the 1.1 limit unless you spend $400 on a video card.

For buying one, Tom's Hardware has a good running monthly article for video cards within a price ranges.

Some specifics on limitations:
40A on 12v max [power supply]
4000MT/s memory throughput [pci-e 1.1]

....but again, you shouldn't hit these limits unless you spend >$400 or use two cards together
