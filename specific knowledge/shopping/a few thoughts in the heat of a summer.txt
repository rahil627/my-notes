elon musk:

like me
has morals
deeply motivated by morals
will guarantee that his newer systems are better than older systems
  - basically just replaces old technology with newer ones, and, hopefully, a higher quality through the process: safer mining techniques, more efficient distribution systems, more safer and efficient manufacturing systems, a good charging system (using renewable sources), and a good recycling system, etc. etc. **He has to re-build all of the systems from scratch, and he will benefit greatly because he will keep innovating along the way.**


the economic and political impacts, i have no idea about, but... i think... it will just shift money and power from the people that owned gas companies to people that owned lithium mining companies, electric car companies, etc. The money just moves around rich investors. Nothing really changes...



environmental impact analysis of lithium-ion cars vs internal combustion engine cars:

from one article [todo: should find a more scientific article], it seems the [environmental] cost to manufacture and recycle the car is about the same, only slightly higher for the electric vehicle. The cost of running it, depends on the sources of energy being used (100% renewable charging stations vs at home), but anyway, regardless of it, the sources of electricity (power plants) are far more efficient at creating power than independent engines burning gas.
