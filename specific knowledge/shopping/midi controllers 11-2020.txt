# for piano playing:
wants:
49-key+ (4+ octaves, 8 white + 5 black per octave)
  - 25-key is only 2 octaves, too small
  - 32-key is between 2 and 3 octaves, still small
pads
  - can assign keys to replace pads until I can get a controller with them
  - could get another device for pads only


keybed quality
  - roland? > arturia > nektar =? m-audio >? midiplus


**novation launchpad 49**
  - **might have the best keyboard and be the best overall midi controller**


**m-audio keystation 49**
  - full-size keys, lighter, plastic
  - 32.36 x 2.68 x 7.44 inches
  - modulation / pitch wheels
  - transport buttons set: d-pad
  - recording buttons set: play/pause/recordo
  - works with iOS
  - **worth hunting for an older mk2 version** for a discount price
  - **49 key version is better than the 61 key**

**Nektar SE49**
  - considered the best cheap 49 keys, though they click

Nektar Impact GX series
  - keys click
  - more resistance than LX series

m-audio keystation 32
  - interesting choice for a mini controller

x/Midiplus AKM320
  - **the keys are awful**, like children’s toys from the 80s!

midiplus x4 pro mini
  - adds 8 pads
  - adds speaker out and pro line outs (L & R)
  - 9 knobs, 8 buttons (pads?) and 5 transport buttons
  - 13.7 x 70.3 x 5.2 (cm) ｜ 5.3 x 27.6 x 2  (in), same size as original version
  - 1.85 (kg)｜ 4.07 (lb), **lighter!!**


x/midiplus x4
  - tried this at the shop, and, though i was pushing through a plastic cover, **the keys sucked**: the keys next to each other became pressed down, and, it was harder to press.
  - **mini-keys**, heavier, **metal**?
  - 5 transport buttons?, **5 knobs**
  - midi out, usb
  - 70.3 x 13.7 x 5.1 (cm) ｜ 27.7 x 5.4 x 2  (in)

  - **mk2 > mk3, better keybed, more durable rubber buttons**

  - compares novation launchkey to m-audio keystation
  - can hear the clicky clacky ness of the novation keyboard

  - **Nektar Impact GX has more resistance than LX**, in an attempt to mimic real piano resistance, it just fights against you


https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-the-Nektar-GX49-or-the-M-Audio-Keystation-49-II-midi-boards?share=1

The Keystation has synth action like a classic synth. Though it also has a rubbery feel at the bottom which is weird. It’s perfectly usable though

Nektar GX49 has deep action with stiffer spring (deeper than my piano). But the Nektar keys feel a bit sloppy and noisy. It was harder to play faster runs with the keys being deep and stiff. For me, playing the springs feels more exhausting than playing a fully weighted piano.

But personally I don’t like semi-weighted action. I prefer classic sync (low tension springs like the Korg Triton) or a fully weighted piano. But some people prefer stiffer springs to help avoid hitting wrong notes.


# for portable workstation

## 25 keys, mini
Akai MK3 mini
  - joystick might break in packing
  - keys are slightly better than Novation’s because it has more depth
  - **no transport controls**
  - more sensitive, professional APC pads
  - more durable hard plastic, compared to Novation, **2lb** weight
  - pitch ‘n mod joystick
  - 8 pads, 8 endless

**Novation Launchpad mini mk3**
  - Ableton-focused workflow transport controls
    - now supports Logic and Reason too
    - can use with anything else though
 - feels like cheap plastic
 - extremely light at **1lb**, thin, ‘n portable, fits in a small backpack
 - pitch ‘n mod touch strips
 - 16 pads, 8 **fixed** knobs
 - **mk2 weights 1.5lb and has better reviews**

**arturia microlab**
  - same and great keybed from keystep ‘n keylab
  - **best choice for mini 25 key for just the piano keys**

**arturia keystep 32**
  - an interesting portable choice
  - **highest quality keybed**, but no pads
  - fantastic connections
  - great quality build
  - **best reviews** on amazon
  - 3lb / 1.4kg, too heavy and at 19”, too large!
 
Arturia MiniLab
  - **best keys**, smoothest, slightly larger keys too
    - but with 25 keys, maybe doesn’t have to be so great?
  - pads are the worst of the three
  - some DAW controls
  - most analog *feeling*
  - **most durable**, metal bottom, but possibly the **heaviest at 3lb ‘n least portable**
    - at 4lb you can get 49 keys!
  - pitch ‘n mod touch strips
  - 16 endless knobs

Alesis v25
  - **best keys** according to one youtube reviewer, still portable, but much longer than the others, rectangular shape, which might work for a long backpack though

Alesis v-mini
  - **the smallest** form factor
  - pitch and mod buttons

M Audio Axiom Air
  - the **keys are tiny**, making it more for general use
  - 8 pads, but “memory banks” to have possibly 80!



conclusion:
The Arturia mini might be *too big, too heavy* for portability, as most 25 keys are, and if you’re going to have another controller just for the keys, then... it won’t be much use.

The Akai and Novation seem to be a better choice, in case it’s used as an additional controller, as they are so small and portable.


set up:
use the mini midi keyboard for Nujabes / lo-fi and Beach House production
  - this takes time, learning software
use a 49 key keyboard for piano production
  - this takes time learning piano

  - very good taste, especially for pianists
  - Arturia keystep as best mini controller, due the keys and connections
  - **Nektar SE49 over m-audio keystation** for the best 49 non-weighted keys

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dJw3lnXyrpw
  - someone tapes really good reviews of midi controllers, here he compared his two favs: komplete kontrol 32 and the novation mini mk3
  - he also loves the m-audio 49, for it’s keys
