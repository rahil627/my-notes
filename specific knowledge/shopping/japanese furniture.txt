First of all Tatami mats are usually for floor coverings while Goza mats are more similar to a throw rug (tatami w/o the thicker layer) You will probably will want to Cover your floor with Tatami mats. 
Yes, Tatami Mats can be installed over your existing rug since they do not require any adhesive or nails, however careful planning is required so that you can get the most out of your floor space. 
Tatami mats made From Japan (Original Country) will be the most expensive but there are good quality ones coming out of Canada and China. 
Usually the typical and traditional mats are filled with wara or rice straws and covered with igusa or the rush mat. More modern Mats use compressed fibre board, covered with a new and unique type of washable and durable Japanese paper. Still Others are filled with Styrofoam. 
Finally Price, again these mats can be very costly they run from $130 dollars to $250 for an average size piece 90cm wide X 180cm long X 6cm thick. (sizes are in Centimeters since they are mostly sold out of country) 
Here are some sites to help you decide...
