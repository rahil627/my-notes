1. psychology might just be the most important field of study for humans, for human well-being

the study of how people work, understanding each other / understanding differences...

personality types is just a tool in psychology to better understand each other.

because there is no way to truly understand a person through physical science methods, we’ve created this entire field out of nothing: just theories!

personality type theory is simply a tool to use to understand other people. (it is just one of many)

2. **i believe in the idea of religion as an amazing way to govern society**

for example, if i created a religion, in which, there are only two rules (as examples):
1. before eating, you mimic the noise of the animal you eat
2. before using a transportation machine, you exercise in proportionate to the amount you travel

i believe if a society followed my religion, they be much more mindful / aware of theirselves and the cost of eating animals and using transportation machines, perhaps even stopping nearly entirely.

mimicking the noise of eating an animal could be a quite haunting experience, and exercise could also be a painful experience, thus they will be avoided.

so, there you go! I stopped the meat industry and the transportation industry.

**it enforces self-control, and, through self-control, we change society by changing ourselves.** The only force is that religious force, which can come through guilt.

**very few of us are built to think about morals, thus a moral authority is necessary in order to control humans, tame us.** **That authority cannot be an individual.** **It must be something else... Something that we would all accept.. Something that we would all accept is better than not having.** **Something based on fundamental human morals.** Love, care, empathy, etc.

2.1. religious revolutions as an amazing way to change society

religious revolutions, like the iranian revolution (aka the islamic revolution) was a religious one that seemingly deterred becoming a part of the *globalized western civilization*, and it seems to be quite an amazing example of one.

[todo: read about iranian revolution]

**religious revolutions often come from a mystical, religious source: an infj type of person.** That person, at times, can even make a revolution without violence, as it happened during the white revolution (iran) and civil rights protest, one led by the Ayatollah of iran, and the other by Martin Luther King Jr.

**merely through words, orations, they are able to change the fundamental blocks of an entire civilization.**

**through words, they convince an entire civilization that this problem of civilization must be changed, and that change comes from within,** within each individual.

**through the use of mere words, they teach us something valueable that can progress an entire civilization.**

and in order for this method to work, humans simply must be humans. They must, somewhere deep inside of them, care: care for others, care for animals, care for the world, etc.

so, **their entire hope relies on the fact (idea?) that we are all humans. That we share some similarities between all of us.** And those similarities are those things that i mentioned are deep inside of us all: care, etc.
