neighborhoods:
inner richmond - around 9th and Geary, Chinatown, many Asian restaurants to eat out at night, and still a great place to live with cheap groceries and eats (dim sum, bahn mi, barkeries, etc.) during the day
outer sunset - around 19th and Irving, cheap Chinatown, everything you need, Noriega and Taraval are meh
the mission - Valencia is nice, gentrified. Mission street is seedy, urban clothing stores, dirty hispanic restaurants. 24th is interesting; It's mostly hispanic, but cleaner than Mission street, filled with cheap bakeries. A really diverse mish-mash of people and shops, from the poor hispanics to young professionals that work nearby. Cheap and expensive eats during the day and night, nice boutiques, and so on. The quantity of shops reminds me of New York. Valencia street is gentrified. Many artists around here.
north beach - cool, albeit touristy, tons of cafes, shops, chinatown nearby for cheaper things

not bad:
inner sunset - around 9th and Irving, nice restaurants to eat out, lacks cheap eats during the day, on average more expensive than outer sunset
hayes valley/nopa/lower pacific heights/etc. - the cost/space is high, food costs more too, ton of shops
panhandle/nopa - not too bad
chinatown - pretty cool, but I imagine the price/size is terrible

meh:
outer richmond - not much going on
russian hill - eh, residential
nob hill - eh, residential, near large hotels
marina/cow hollow - ew, white
castro - meh, clean, small town feel, not too interesting
noe valley - very small town feel

Heya,

I'm Rahil, age 24, male. I just moved back in to SF early March from NY. In the past I've had software developer jobs but right now I'm into video game design and possibly looking to get into film. I'm not currently working, but I have enough to pay for however long. I'm rather quiet, usually out of the house, at a library as I don't feel as productive when I'm at home. If there's a living room, I'd surely be down for chillin out. Just check out my website if you need to know more about me.

Rahil
