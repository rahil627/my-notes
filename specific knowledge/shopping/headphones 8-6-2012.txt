Ones I tried at the store that were awesome:
Audio Technica ATH-AD700*, and 900
AKG-240
AKG-701

conclusion:
I bought the Ultrasone HFI-780 for a more fun feeling headphone, surround sound technology, which is the opposite of the HD 280. It should be good for indie music. One problem is that the headphones are likely just as uncomfortable as the HD 280. I would have bought the Denon AH-D2000 if they were $200; They were currently selling for $400.

what i want:
open vs closed?
closed

budget vs professional?
~$250 seems to be the sweet spot

sound?
nuetral

problems with old headphone?
my old headphones (Sennheiser HD 280 Pro) have the in your head feel, tight clamp, doesn't provide enough bass even with an amp, but otherwise it sounds nice. So, I want a more airy, more comfortable, more bass, and equal or better sound), more isolation. I also don't want to buy an expensive amp to power it.

quotes:
"he HD595 is still one of my most favorite cans, and quite justifiably, due to its very open and airy sound, as if I'm listening to speakers or listening to a live concert. In the headphone community, open-back headphones are arguably the best-sounding type of headphones, since they do not restrict airflow, thereby making them very natural-sounding. Now, one of the downsides to having open-back headphones is sound leakage. Being designed the way they are, sound that is being made around you can easily be heard, and similarly, the music you're listening to can also be heard by those around you. The second drawback to open-back headphones is that the bass response is usually not as resonant as those on IEMs (in-ear monitors), or closed-back cans. This lack of bass can usually be corrected by playing with the EQ, having a dedicated amp/DAC, and/or buying more expensive headphones like the Sennheiser HD 650 Headphones."

"though all closed-back headphones get old after a while" - referring to the fatigue of closed headphones
