tools:
  - crank brothers 17 vs 19
    - difference is fatter version of flathead and phillips

pedals:
  - platform
    - can add straps if wanted?

final:
- windsor cyclo 54cm black
  - can add a rack an pannier
  - can paint it to remove decals
- call stores, ask for initial assembly and tune-up for a bike bought from online
  - if not, do it myself, could be fun, and a good learning experience
  
  - http://nycbikecommuter.info/?p=1041
    - a great article which describes the kinds of bikes and how they fare in commuting
  
  - I think the problem while testing the bikes is that I am used to my first bike, which is similar to a commuter bike. Easy turning due to the frame geometry (I'm currently afraid of turning sharply with a road bike), more comfortable seating position, etc. I think I just have to ride a road bike more to get comfortable with it, and turn better
  
  - cyclocross vs touring vs commuter
    - cyclocross is similar to road with a fatter wheel
    - touring usually has steel, more braze-ons, mountain bike components
    - commuter (fitness bike) usually has a flat bar, mountain bike components
    - all 700cc wheels

just buy a recent bike, mid-range
  - road bike feels great
    - begins as $700
    - can replace tires with knobby tires
    - 10 speed is the standard, if you wanted to upgrade (Tiagra, 105, Ultegra)
    - if i buy from store, free tune-ups for life (depends on how long that store lasts!)
      - i may enjoy tuning up my own bike
  - cyclocross bike vs tourist bike
  - upright?
  - little brakes on the front
  - should be able to hold groceries
  
- brand doesn't matter much, most are made from the same place and have the same parts
- can order any bike seen online and buy from local bike store
  - saves assembly cost and likely offers free adjustments
  - might be marked up
