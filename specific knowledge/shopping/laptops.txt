Buying a laptop/notebook

black friday, people ask me for computer shopping advice
link coding horror's, better to blog than email.

They all seem similar from the specifications. I wouldn't worry about the computer components so much as they are all more than capable of normal office use. At this price point I would worry more about the workmanship (case/display/input devices).

If you do buy a laptop at a store, test them all out yourself:
-try typing. Does it feel good or do the keys flex too much?
-try the mousepad. Does it even work properly?
-look at the screen. Is it too dim, or is there a really narrow viewing angle?
-does it have an HDMI port?
-does it have good battery life?
-does it look ugly?

I'm not sure what your criteria is but I'm sure after testing it at the store you'll be able to make the right choice.

Or at least that is how I felt when I was looking for a laptop. Take Sheetal with you; She has good taste and can narrow down the choices.

When I went to Best Buy to test out some laptops, I felt that Samsung consistently had better workmanship, but I doubt there will be much on sale from them.
