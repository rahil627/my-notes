  - 180 days expiration, buy any amount to recharge phone (minimum 150) to get another 180 days. Or get unlimited internet for one month to extend another 3 months. Or get GB of internet to extend for 6 months.
  - can check online auction shops for cheap recharge cards, especially the unlimited internet one.

# notes
a 4G SIM card is backwards compatible for 3G/2G
  - (so, one can use/buy a newer 4G card, but still use an older 3G plan)
