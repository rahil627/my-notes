t&g 117
t&g 125 - smaller, but nastier sound and less bass

jbl flip 4 - 900thb, less on fb-mp
tribit go - 1600thb
ue wanderboom - 2100thb, 1500 on fb-mp
sony xb10/12 - $30 new, wonderboom competitor, good for 360 sound
tribit stormbox micro


The JBL Flip 5 came very close to being a top pick—it falls between the UE Wonderboom 2 and the Sony SRS-XB33 in price and performance. Our panelists thought it sounded a tad bright but very good overall. However, we got only about six hours of battery life from it.

The JBL Go 3 is a nice little ultra-tiny, ultra-portable speaker, but it doesn’t sound as full as the Tribit StormBox Micro.
