“Krav maga rules:
1: hit the balls
2: hit until they drop
3: then hit until they stop moving”

from a description of a fake Raymond Belle video:
“With his athletic ability, Raymond became the regiment's champion rope-climber and joined the regiment's elite team, composed of the unit's fittest and most agile firefighters. Its members were the ones called for the most difficult and dangerous rescue missions.”


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freerunning
  - “Freerunning (or free running/FR) is an acrobatic and athletic discipline founded by Sébastien Foucan, who wrote a book on the subject. Foucan started what he termed "freerunning" in 2003, which he developed as a more inclusive form of parkour.”
  - “Foucan wanted to create a discipline that was more personal to the individual than parkour and more easily adapted to suit each person's individual goals.[5] His idea was similar to that of Bruce Lee's creation of Jeet Kune Do. Foucan wanted to take everything that he had found useful and that he liked from his parkour experiences and combine it into one sport.”

  - how we all started parkour

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour
Raymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings[which?] that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.[4][18]

Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]

more on landing:
you’ll be landing on the balls of your feet and might be tucking to roll, so prepare your body for those movements.
Your feet should be parallel, about shoulder-width apart

Land onto the balls of your feet. The ball of your foot is the spot between your toes and your arch.

Keep your legs bent. You don’t want to lock your knees, or you’ll injure them. Keep a soft bend in your legs so your hamstrings can take the absorption of your landing.

Put your arms out for balance. Putting your arms out to the side or in front of you can help with balance.

lower heels

stand up

hand variation:
lean forward and touch ground in front with palms, on all fours, but with only balls of feet touching ground

roll variation:
momentum in front, tuck legs in, shoulders forward, push off with toes
