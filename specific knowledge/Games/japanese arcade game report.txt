Oh my. Just found this on the internet in related videos:

Otherwise, the arcades are all very similar. They are separated into floors: CLAW MACHINES, technical / RTS (very calculating, army strategy, cards that are read digitally games, simulators), gambling (panchinko, mahjong, smoking), music (DDR, the ones I linked), and normal (mario kart racing machines, armored core with dual joysticks, retro, fighters, etc.).

It's nice that the space exists, but it doesn't seem like many people who play are very social. Just, uh, people who want to relieve some stress for a few minutes, or technical arcade players. Also, you can't hear anything in the music or panchinko floors. It feels like an unsocial club. The pig and taiko games are usually in the front of the arcade store, drawing the broadest crowd.


I FORGOT A FLOOR. There's a floor dedicated for those machines where girls take polaroid pictures in a booth.
