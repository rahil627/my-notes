# security:

lock designs:
"cable" locks
  - I think just a thin chain inside
  - generally regarded as useless
"U"-lock
  - good weight / strength ratio for bicycles, though maybe difficult to lock the bike frame to many things
  - also, probably too small for most motorcycle frames. Perhaps if one drills holes in the plastic casing?
chains:
  - **need hardened steel, "high security", not some China-made junk**
  - hexagonal vs normal? Not sure. Maybe more hinderance against bolt-cutters.
  - **noose (style) chain with padlock**
    - best solution for motorcycles
    - saves chain weight
  - **chain with padlock**
    - **cheap, quick, stupidly simple solution for buying local, just need to ensure the padlock key / keyhole design is decent, in addition to matching thickness.** Way better than poorly designed u-locks.
      - need to make access to the keyhole difficult when locking
      - make sure it's made in Taiwan, not China
    - can throw another cheap lock on, but may waste time
  - chain with two padlocks
  - two chains with one padlock
  - folding chains
    - adds portability, but maybe not as durable?

12mm minimum
12-15mm can be cut with monster bolt cutters, with good leverage / position / strength
16mm+ cannot be cut with portable bolt cutters

ways of stealing and solutions:
lifting
  - tie it down with a chain lock
riding
  - wheel lock
    - key lock through the wheel spokes (for cheap, public bicycles)
  - handle-bar lock
    - key lock in the turning pole
    - after-market solution?
  - prevent the bike from starting
    - install a removable ignition board
    - seems like it may not be worth the hassle of installing or carrying around, compared to a simple handle or wheel lock
  - chain wheels
    - not so useful for the entire bike, but good in case of wheel theft
rolling
  - wheel lock
    - auto disc brake
      - though seemingly useless, might be useful when someone is trying to steal a motorcycle whilst it being in sight of the owner

extra:
**add an alarm system**
  - tilting sensor?
  - GPS sensor?

how to lock:
to an "anchor" cemented to concrete
not the wheels: they are easy to remove
frame
  - any part of the frame of the motorcycle?
  - seat and bottom tube of bicycle
lock in such a way that the lock is positioned in a place where bolt cutting would be impossible

a torch and electric saw can eventually cut anything with time and noise
