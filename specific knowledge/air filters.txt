fiberglass - the cheap blue filters, only lasts a month or two, depending on use
pleated - like fiberglass except they are folded over for more surface area, lasting twice as long
electrostatic - washable/reusable, usually in a metal frame, low MERV rating

MERV rating - (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value) is an industry standard used to rate media type air filters. A filter with a higher MERV rating is more efficient than one with a lower MERV rating.
Arrestance is the measure of a filters ability to capture dust particles under test conditions. This is not a good method of selecting the best filter for your needs because this rating is obtained under test conditions using larger sized particles.
