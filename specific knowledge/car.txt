from an old paper titled "Car Maintenance":
when refueling:
	check fluid levels: brake and clutch, engine coolant, engine oil, washer, automatic transaxle, power steering
monthly:
	check tire pressure

appearance care:
when refeuling:
	clean off bird droppings, insects, and other crap with a wet tissue from the gas station
	use window cleaner if it's on the window
monthly:
	pressure wash
4-6 months:
	wax
	clean interior

from an old paper titled "Efficient Driving":
can skip gear shifts but stay >2000rpm
10-15% engine tuning
5-33 aggressive driving
100lb = 2% mpg
idling = 0mpg
cruise control = constant speed, better than most humans
0-10% oil and filter
0-3% tire inflation
1-2% recommended oil
10% air conditioner

best at 30/60mpg, sucks at <25 and >60
turn off engine if idle over 30 seconds
no need to warm up the car in the winter
shift to neutral at long red lights and other stops
higher gear = more efficient, getting to the highest gear quickly = efficiency
lower gear on hills/curves
the colder the engine, the more fuel it uses to start the car
use windows on local streets and air conditioner or vent on the highway
accelerate smoothly/consistently
anticipate stops and coast (let go of acceleration)
refuel at empty, don't partially refuel

walmart prices:
	$10 flat repair
	$30 service, includes oil change, filling fluids,  tire inflation, vacuum interior, check other stuff
	do state inspections!

buying a used car:
	g35, 100k, $10,000
	328i, 75k, $19,000
	celica GT, 136k, $4000 (craigslist)
	mazda 3 S, 83k, $7500
	mazda rx-8, 75k $12800 (craigslist)
	
	conclusion: luxury cars end up $10,000 at 100k miles, economy $5000 100k
		it's much tougher to find a cheap economy card than a cheap luxury car. For some reason 100k economy cars level at $10,000

clean/detail/wax process
http://cars.about.com/od/adviceforowners/ss/howtodetailext.htm
http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/repair/1272211

wash with hose with a spray attachment or a local power wash, then hose without attachment, flooding the car
wash door jambs
use vinyl/rubber cleaner on black parts (around doors)
clay the car if it hasn't been washed/waxed for a while. To test, run finger across car, is it smooth? Don't drop the clay!
polish (pre-wax)
wax car - Wax when water no longer beads on the surface of the paint, otherwise you can use polish. Wax in shade for non-sythetic waxes.
	be careful not to get it on the black trim or emblems
use microfibre towel or brush to clean any wax that has gotten on the emblems

maintenance
shila
2001? lexus RX300?
oil and filter, rotation, lube locks every 4 [i do 6] months or 5000 miles
Clean, fresh oil is amber clear. Used oil is sooty and dark. can mark oil filter before oil change, to see if they change it.
dueler h/t bridgestone p225/70r16 101s, 44psi max, ~32-35 cold?
firestone - 547-7784, can drop car off and even has state inpsections on sundays

best tires
good year assurance triple tread vs michelin hydroedge/harmony/hydroedge with green x
	goodyear has 80k warranty, best bet
	hydro has 90k warranty/best tread life
	harmony is like hydro with focus on comfort
	hydro with green x is a fuel saving tire
good year assurance comfor tread - great ride/noise
Hankook Optimo H727 vs Yokohama AVID TRZ/TOURING-S - budget, hancock as 100k warranty tread
Michelin Primacy MXV4 - performance
Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - max performance, $193
Continental ExtremeContact DWS - extreme high performance, 6 Years / 50,000 miles, $126
Continental ExtremeContact DW - max performance summer, $133

fluids
antifreeze & coolants - make sure colors match (yellow/green/orange/pink), still there are some differences of the same colored coolants. check when it gets cold. prestone or any brand? mixing antifreeze can reduce performance. shila's needs ehylene glycol. buy the full not 50/50. http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/products/1272436
washer fluid with antifreeze - $1 for a large container, any brand

fuel saving tips - http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/103164/article.html

maintenance

tire inflation
Excessive wear on both outer edges = under inflation.
Excessive wear in center of tread indicates over-inflation.
best to replace all 4 tires
next best to replace tires in pairs
Gas mileage drops about 1% for every pound of tire pressure below recommended level.
every 10 degree drop in temperature, tire pressure decreases by one pound.
Have your car's alignment checked once a year.

tune-ups
Keep the engine tuned properly. Checking spark plugs, oxygen sensors, air filters, hoses and belts are a few examples of maintenance that can save a vehicle owner up to 165 gallons of gas per year, resulting in potential savings of $350.
A car in tune consumes 20 percent less fuel and releases less heat trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Get tune-ups (or do them yourself) as recommended by your owner's manual.
The following emission control parts should be inspected:
Charcoal canister: absorbs gasoline fumes from fuel system and routes them into the engine.
Positive crankcase ventilation valve: The PCV system recycles gases into the engine for combustion.
Exhaust gas recirculation: The EGR system cuts down on the formation of nitrogen oxides, which sunlight transforms into smog.
Fuel injectors: Deliver the right amount of fuel to the cylinders.
Catalytic converter: Turns carbon monoxide and unburned gas into carbon dioxide and water. Most converters also break down nitrogen oxides.
Other items to check during a check-up:
Dirty air filters restrict airflow and decrease energy efficiency.
Clogged fuel injectors produce a mix too lean or too rich, which hurts your engine, your fuel economy and the atmosphere.
Worn spark plugs misfire, causing fuel to pass through the exhaust system unburned.
A thermostat that lets the engine run too cool or too hot wastes gas and increases exhaust emissions.
Change or adjust these parts according to the schedule in your owner's manual to keep emissions down.

insurance adjuster letter analyzed and questioned

CCC bases prices is based on market research from local dealers and newspapers
KBB, NADA, edmunds prices is a guide

What CCC doesn't know is if you had recent maintenance done, if you had a recent paint job, upholester replacement, or a new set of tires put on your car.

http://www.stephencryanpc.com/Articles.shtml CCC 

salvage value? - 15%-20% of actual cash value depending on age
comp - comparable property


1) how come the salvage value is so high? 4000/16000 = 25%!
2) baseline adjustment = -688?

out of the 3 car comparable cards, only two were the same model.
The "take" prices were:
$16000 @ 23500 miles [my car reference]
$16000 @ 37000 miles comp1
$16400 @ 42000 miles comp2

i'm ignoring the following:
take price = -$1000
options = -$250 to -$500
value given = $200 over the lowest adjusted value

the "take price" assumes that the insured can bargain dealers down to their lowest sale (a very large assumption).
i won't bother with fighting for the options, since the CCC system seems to pick and choose random features here.
the value i was given was $200 over the lowest value. this nearly assumes i can find the best deal possible.
the dealers were 150 miles away


after a flood
do not turn the car on
wet vac what you can immediately (without removing anything)
call your insurance company
check oil, if there is water, do not drive it, change your oil

how to clean a car after a flood
wash the outside of car - disinfectant and hot pressure washer

[costly?] fog (atomize) the car
wet vac the inside of the car
dehumidify the inside
reassemble
re-grease bare metal parts nad seat adjusters

electronics under the car - airbags, heated seats



how to take care of leather upholstery (seats and steering wheel)
travel blanket - cover backseat
sun reflector - cover front seats
Leather cleaner - 3-4x per year
leather conditioner - once per year (during spring)
'ink stick' - stain remover

Supagard Leather Kit
AutoSmart products

general wear - connollise ASAP

other
the cost of damage typically decreases the value of a car by three times the cost of repair
http://www.clean-image.co.uk/articles/increase-the-value-of-your-car.htm
write off - cost of damage is greater than the cost of repair
