my room:
wash shower tiles
vacuum carpet/wash floors
floor sills, window sills
flip mattress (last time:8/26/2009 horizontally)
wash bed sheets/comforter
clean PC

entire house:

checking shila's bills:
gas			~$25-225	used by water heater and gas stoves
electricity		~$100		most comes from air conditioner
water & wastewater 	~$150-200	drinking water, sink drain, toilets

while on vacation:
leave heat on the lowest temperature setting
use a timer to turn a light on from sunset to midnight
check for running toilets - check for sound. if it's running, turn the valve off underneath the toilet.
check windows - make sure they are closed properly.
check the outside of the house
check outside valves - make sure they are completely off
[why not just turn off the main valve?]
if you can hear water near the main shut off valve, located near the water heater, then water is running somewhere.
leave all main doors open
check the outside of house, make sure everything looks okay.
drive car every few weeks(?)

during winter:
detach any garden hose from outside valves
if temperature is below freezing, turn the kitchen sink and a bathroom sink on very low overnight. [not sure how many times you must do this]
