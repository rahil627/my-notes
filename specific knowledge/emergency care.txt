https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation
  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, commonly known as CPR,[1] is an emergency procedure that combines chest compression often with artificial ventilation in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest. It is indicated in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing, for example, agonal respirations.
  - CPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart; Its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart. The objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage. Administration of an electric shock to the subject's heart, termed defibrillation, is usually needed in order to restore a viable or "perfusing" heart rhythm. Defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms, namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity. CPR may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm that may be shockable. In general, CPR is continued until the person has a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or is declared dead.
  - In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, compression-only CPR by the lay public has a higher success rate than standard CPR.[34] The exceptions are cases of drownings, drug overdose and arrest in children. Children who receive compression-only CPR have the same outcomes as those having received no CPR.[4]:S646…As per the American Heart Association, the beat of the Bee Gees song "Stayin' Alive" provides an ideal rhythm in terms of beats per minute to use for hands-only CPR.[36] One can also hum Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust", which is exactly 100 beats-per-minute and contains a memorable repeating drum pattern.[37] For those with non cardiac arrest and people less than 20 years of age, standard CPR is superior to compression-only CPR.[38][39]

  - 1. CALL
Check the victim for unresponsiveness. If the person is not responsive and not breathing or not breathing normally [or moving, or responding to voice]. Call 911 and return to the victim.
  - 2. PUMP
If the victim is still not breathing normally, coughing or moving, begin chest compressions.  Push down in the center of the chest [between nipples, with bottom of palm at the sternum] 2-2.4 inches 30 times. Pump hard and fast at the rate of 100-120/minute, faster than once per second.
  - 3. BLOW
Tilt the head back and lift the chin [to avoid tongue from blocking airway?]. Pinch nose and cover the mouth with yours and blow until you see the chest rise. Give 2 breaths.  Each breath should take 1 second.

CONTINUE WITH 30 PUMPS AND 2 BREATHS UNTIL HELP ARRIVES 
NOTE: This ratio is the same for one-person & two-person CPR.  In two-person CPR the person pumping the chest stops while the other gives mouth-to-mouth breathing.

Complications of CPR
Vomiting is the most frequently encountered complication of CPR. If the victim starts to vomit, turn the head to the side and try to sweep out or wipe off the vomit. Continue with CPR.

The spread of infection from the victim to the rescuer is exceedingly rare. Most cardiac arrests occur in people's homes - relatives or friends will be the ones needing to do CPR. Even CPR performed on strangers has an exceedingly rare risk of infection. There is NO documentation of HIV or AIDS ever being transmitted via CPR.

Checking The Pulse
The pulse check is no longer taught or expected of laypersons. Instead if there are no signs of life (such as no breathing, no movement, no response to voice) begin to pump on the chest. Provide two mouth-to-mouth breaths after every 30 compressions. Please note that the pulse check is expected of health care providers.
