You can grow oranges, lemons, limes, and kumquats, indoors on smaller dwarf trees. They do require large pots and must have regular watering for their fruit to grow. These trees should be misted regularly if your home is dry. They need as much sunlight as possible so should be kept near a sunny window or put out for the summer if possible. If you are moving an indoor plant to the outdoors for the summer, make sure you do so gradually or the sudden change will shock the plant. Set it out at first for only a few hours.
