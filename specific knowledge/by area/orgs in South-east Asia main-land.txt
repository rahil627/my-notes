art life in main-land South-east Asia

grassroots, feminist, farmer, nature, anarchy:
m/https://www.auntieornscooking.com/live-learn-homestay
  - very good business model

http://grassrootsvolunteering.org/volunteer_opportunities
  - most are just ways to get money or teach languages. Very few actually aim for self-reliance.

m/https://www.licadho-cambodia.org
  - mostly human rights monitoring and defense, but also ground-work, medicine, and law
  - hiring, but must know Cambodian language

international women’s development agency:

http://www.punpunthailand.org/
  - “self-reliance center”
  - great, worth visiting, but volunteers must pay

http://www.mindfulfarmers.org/volunteering.html
  - mostly organic farming, and giving good food to their village
  - 3 meals per day at 200baht, not bad
  - just out-side of Chiang Mai!
  - but, a rather strict work schedule, though, only for 4 + 2 hours / day
