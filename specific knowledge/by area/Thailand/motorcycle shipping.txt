  - “The biggest problem you may encounter is when loading the bike at stations that are not the final stations of the route, such as Chumphon or Nakhon Sawan. There is sometimes friction between the train staff and the station staff, especially on night trains. The motorcycle might get refused or they simply can not load it in the short time the train stops there. This is a fraught experience. The procedure is that they will then put it on a later train. If you find this is the case go to see the main guard for your train, show him your paperwork and find out what has happened and when the bike will arrive. He can call the station and find out when it will be sent.”
