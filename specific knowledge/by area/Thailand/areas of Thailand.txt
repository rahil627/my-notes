  - To drive from Phuket to Udon Thani is fun until after Ranong - reaching the main Highway - than it is about 1000+ km nearly straight - no fun lot traffic and threw or around Bangkok - no fun for me - using up the tires and engine and gasoline for no fun - With the 400 CBR Honda and high revs nearly 20 years old also not - I drive Udon Thani - Chiang Mai - in  2 days - I not so young anymore and 400 km a day enough for my ass and my hands - go around Chiang Rai - Mae Sai - Pua - Nan that is fun - with Honda CB 650 F and go mountains and hills and winding roads - not eating 750 - 1000 km a day on Highways OMG lol ha ha
  - Udon Thani - Chiang Mai - 780 km - that is a good piece of transfer road to reach Thailand motorbike heaven in North ðŸ˜‰
