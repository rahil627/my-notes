  - todo: **says can adjust rear shock absorbers!**

how to add the correct fuel to oil ratio:

**my GTO came with an oil pump!**

20-50ml per liter, depending on motorcycle, **see motorcycle manual**
30-40ml usually, with 40 as normal running and 30 for really really revving it, as in extreme dirt bike racing

**25ml - 40:1 ratio**
31ml - 32:1 ratio

1 table-spoon: 10-15ml
1 soup-spoon: 15ml
standard bottle cap: 2.5 ml
oil bottle cap: 25ml? / 2 table-spoons
... **hopefully the oil bottle comes with measurement readings**

13.5L petrol tank
337ml max / empty tank
325ml for 13L
**250ml for 10L**
  - good for oil cans, as they come in .5L and 1L sizes

just do the math at the gas station

  - beautiful video of dis-assembling a GTO engine! it’s so simple, like taking lego pieces off. Makes motorcycle maintenance all feel very simple and normal to do.
