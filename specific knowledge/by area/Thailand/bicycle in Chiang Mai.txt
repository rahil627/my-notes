  - a solid post; contains links to lists of bicycle shops, bicycle shop reviews, other possible other places to buy them, etc.

https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/23529/how-many-years-an-aluminium-frame-lasts-in-a-touring-bike
  - aluminum frames last on average 5-10 years of regular use
  - if it cracks, though it can be welded, chances are it’s going to crack elsewhere, so it’s best to replace it
  - from my experience, aluminum frames feel as if they weigh much less, even less than a steel fixed gear! But, looking at info on the internet, there’s not much difference: 30lb steel, 25lb aluminum, 20lb composite; yet, there are many aluminum bikes that weigh 30lb too...

what do i want?:
a “hybrid” city bike:

examples:
https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/cross-city-2-disc
  - this a feature-full version with 2 disc brakes, and some tech for better suspension
  - there’s an “equipped” version with a rack, fenders, and something else already installed

https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/mountain-bikes/cross-country-mountain-bikes/marlin/marlin-5/p/23134/
  - the Marlin is a popular flexible bike, here it has 29” mountain-bike wheels, and space for a rack

features:
**geared, even 3 gears may be enough, as long as they can be adjusted, if not less than 10 gears is enough**
**raised handle-bars**
  - for **a more up-right seating position**
**L-shaped handle-bars or road bike handle-bars**
  - **for various holding positions**
the lighter the better
  - steel for heavy touring, aluminum for light touring


extras:
rack (rear)
basket (rear)
reflectors (front and back)
water bottle holder
fenders
etc. practical stuff

**pleather handle-bar grips**
**a comfy seat**
pegs


others bikes that i like:
BMX-like commuter bikes
  - probably the most fun bike, turned practical
  - reminds me of my childhood
  - this sort of bike with a few gears would be really cool
fixed-gear hybrid
  - cool, but fixed gear is really rough on the legs, so, it’s better to go with at-least a 8 x 1 gear
  - there’s tech to switch from free-wheel and proper fixed riding (chain fixed to pedals)


digital classifieds:
**Facebook marketplace**
  - this is the most popular place
