survival:
go to day markets and buy fresh fruit and vegetables
  - **a bunch of bananas can be found for th$10!!**. this is absolutely the best deal for food
during the summer heat:
eat fruit and drink tea during the day
eat anything during the evening

costs
5b bowl of rice
5b snack
12b 250ml coke
15-30b per plastic bag of food
30-60b per loaf of bread
**25b 500g raw chicken breast**
**15b fried fish**
10b fried noodles in a leaf
10b fried rice in a leaf
5b boiled egg
3b raw egg

buy a bowl of rice and put it into metal tin
  - keep a bottle of soy sauce on you
  - if at home: keep cooked curries
  - it’s only **th$30/kg of rice**, th$40-50/kg of specialty rices (black, etc.)
    - can probably ask to mix rices!

buying tips:
generally just don’t buy from places that don’t list prices
  - and that goes for anything: from restaurants to general stores
  - day-markets are the main exception, as fruits, vegetables, and spices shops don’t list prices

$30-35 4-pack of Panasonic batteries
$30 natural Thai shampoo or conditioner
$30? tub of bee’s-wax lotion

th$40-60 for a plate of food
  - th$10 per portion of rice
    - most of the money is wasted here. need to just buy a bunch of curries, then cook rice at home
    - to eat a big meal, you’d have to order a plate (40-60), then buy 1-3 extra portions of rice

th$10 for x weight of bananas (a kilo?)

(Thailand:)
30 days visa-exempt.
15 days visa-exempt, if by land-crossing? limited to two crossings per calendar year?

After you get into Thailand, you can extend the visa *once* for a maximum of 30-days, whether it’s visa-exempt or an actual tourist visa doesn’t matter, both are considered “tourist visa”s.

**A new rule exists now: can’t *immediately* enter Thailand via land border crossing twice (or thrice?). So, either have to book a flight back, or, stay a week in the other country, or, get a tourist visa.**

There are 60-day single-entry visas ($40 + possibly saved passport stamp space?). Have to fetch it from a nearby country’s embassy, but maybe have to begin the process online? It takes a few days to process.

There are various visas for 90-day single ($80 + saved passport space) and optional multiple-entry ($200), but, they require a bit of paper-work to get. Some ways seem okay: media (film-producer) and study. Something to look into once one is secure and plan to stay only in Thailand.

After scoring a tourist visa, or, finding the cheapest flight into Thailand, then, it’s best to find a way to get an actual visa, which last one-year. There are volunteer visas, and school visas (for language study?, and surely otherwise). But... after that... then what? Maybe knowing the language will give me points with immigration?

Land border crossings to Cambodia are generally sketchy ($30-35 *with US$ bills*). Crossings to Laos are better but have varying visa costs. Crossing to Malsysia is best, albeit far.

Cambodia
  - full of scams, several kinds, on both sides, at several border crossings
  - us$ bills required to get best rate ($30)

Laos:
There are visas on arrival (th$1200-1500/$30-51, better with US$ bills) and e-visas ($30-100) to Laos. Wikitravel notes e-visa prices can be random and higher than visa-on-arrival, and, has a “special line” which can be slower, but, it could save a passport page.

Myanmar:
There’s also crossings to Myanmar, in which you get a day-visa for th$500 and just walk back the same day (then it’s ~$8/day stay in Myamar).

Malaysia
Luckily, there’s even one crossing via train(!!!) to Malaysia; So, can either fly (Air Asia or Nok Air) or train out ‘n in. Plus, Malaysia’s visa-exempt (free) and for 90 days. This also might save passport space.

conclusion:
Either do the day-trip to Myanmar, or, go to Malaysia. Plan early. Buy a flight early, maybe only $20 one-way (less than the cost of most visas). This also might save passport space. Keep the Myanmar option as a last-minute backup; Try to avoid using up the land-border visa runs. Then, extend for 30 days.

At the moment, I don’t feel it’s worth going to an embassy in another country to apply for a 60-day tourist visa, unless one has a solid place to hang-out for a few days while it’s processing.

In case of doing a land-crossing, it might be possible to just camp around Malaysia for a week, before returning to Thailand by air. Sleep around small train stations?


extension:
https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/1070636-30-day-arrival-stamp-30-day-extension/
  - can get a “standard” 30 days on a visa-exempt, only more for those that are married
  - can apply for it at any-time (and it will just tack on the days after the current visa expires)

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/1155116-immigration-is-allowing-30-day-extensions-of-entries-memorandum-dated-1803/page/35/#comments
  - a case where if you are denied your extension, you get a 7-day grace period, but, then if you try to extend it again, your extension now begins on the date your application was rejected 

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/1149816-visa-extension-run-rules/
  - the people on the boards seem to agree that it’s only possible to get a *visa-exempt* entry twice *by land* per calendar year (Jan to Dec)
    - so, **if you fly in, extend, land, extend, land, extend, you can get 180 days per year with just visa-exempt entires!**
    - **it seems you could just fly in visa-exempt (or apply for a proper tourist visa) and then extend as much as you want though...** It’s just that the immigration may become more and more suspicious.

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/959042-only-2-visa-exempt-entries-at-border-crossings-per-calendar-year-effective-dec-31st/
  - just land border crossings are clamped on, air crossings seem to be okay

90-day reporting:
**Necessary**; If you don’t report your location, then immigration can fine you up-to a maximum of $66 (th$2000)!

it’s a simple form, half-a-page, just needs some identity info and the address of the place you’re staying at. The process probably only takes 5 minutes. **It might be possible to do online!**

TM30 and TM28:
you’re supposed to register where you stay using the TM30 *and* the TM28. The TM30 is done by hotels, but, if you have your own place, then, you must do it your-self. The TM28 is done by you.

The TM30 is more important. The TM28 is rather superfluous.

For many visas, the TM30 is asked for, and stapled to the passport. The TM28 can maybe(?) be done at the immigration office.

This has existed in the law for a long time, but, now, it’s finally being enforced... rarely and randomly, of course.

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/856883-notification-of-residence-for-foreigners-via-internet/page/2/#comments
  - many people were charged th$1600 during their 90-day report because they did not bring / file a TM30. (th$1600 is the max fine).

other docs:
TM6 - departure card, must keep it as it has an important stamp on it
TM7 - extension, th$1900
TM8 - re-entry permit, in case you have a single-entry tourist visa and have leave and come back, costs th$1000-1500(?), so, only useful for people who have 90+ day visas


visa refs:
https://www.expatden.com/thailand/thailand-tourist-visa/
  - by far the best site / blog, run by a couple. Their info during the virus-out-break was amazing
https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html
  - quite good info for all countries, including safety
https://thaiembdc.org/visas/
  - main embassy site for the US (although, there are other embassies)
https://www.immigration.go.th/faq
  - Thailand’s immigration department site
  - seems sloppy, old

transport for visa runs:
remember: must fly *in* to avoid counting as an over-land visa run

trains:
$pennies on the Thailand side
$? on the Malaysian side

flights:
$20 for any national flight
$15-$30 for any flight between Malaysia and Thailand via Air Asia (because it’s headquartered there)
  - ~$30 from/to Chiang Mai
  - ~$15 from/to southern Thailand
  - low-cost Malaysian airports include Penang (George Town), Kuala Lumpur, and Kota Bahru (Kelantan!). Best to just go to the border and train back, or, if you have money, make a trip in Kelantan! Just hitch-hike around.

living in Thailand:

resident certificate:
requires TM30 to be done, either online or by paper, but, if it’s by paper, then the person hosting you will need to come. In my case, my host did it online and I believe the officer actually called them!

also requires a lease contract. This can just be a simple letter, “something that shows the address” (that’s what the officer wrote on the requirements paper). In my case, the officer didn’t even want the lease contract; She said the TM30 was enough.

transfer (and register) a motorcycle:
requires resident certificate

Thai driver’s license:
requires a resident certificate
if you have a license (car and/or motorcycle) *and* an international license, you can just get the Thai driver’s license without doing the tests! Otherwise, you must take and pass the tests.
  - the international license is simply a paper pamphlet full of translations, and, mainly, a page where it shows what licenses you have. On that page, and all of the translated versions of that page, there are stamps from the organization that approved it (AAA, etc.). It seems really simple to find a copy, print it out, then fill it out. It’s just a form, hand-written parts on blanks. But, of course, you need the proper license first! That’s the main document, not this measly translation book.

thai language wiki
  - mostly made up of 4 ancient languages: Pali, Mon, Sanskrit, Old Khmer!

travel info:
see life documentation folder

https://www.travelfish.org/alldestinations/thailand
  - many brief writings on towns, ratings for each, of most areas in Thailand
  - they seem to prefer remote, warm-hearted quaint places
  - good to add some destinations

thoughts on a trip from Bangkok to Chiang Mai
https://www.travelfish.org/trip_planner/stops-between-bangkok-and-chiang-mai
  - great, blunt “slow” travel info

I think its best to simply stop by tiny towns and sleep at the train station. The more rural, the better. But, perhaps, best not to have money on me...

I *feel* that is the best because with such a heavy back-pack (plus two more bags!!), it would be difficult to travel without a motorcycle: it would involve finding a hostel, getting there: meaning, finding bus stations and catching buses, staying the night, forced to trip during the day, then forced to stay another night, because I *want* to travel (move) during the day. So, I would have to spend two nights in every place that I stop, or, one night, and I just keep moving and bussing.

Compare that to motorcycling. **With a motorcycle, I am *free*.**

**The next best thing to a motorcycle is the train. With a train, at least, you can stop whenever and wherever you want**, and just catch the next train, going at your own pace, letting the train move you, and allowing more time in the mind.

So, just check the maps to see what little train station towns are on the way, and make your own little town trip.

towns on the way
(Bangkok)
Ayuthaya
  - right next to the train station!
small towns: Tha Rua, Ban Mo
(Lop Buri) - 750k!, can skip
a ton of small towns
(Phitsanoluk) - avoid, sounds like a dull transit hub
a few small towns
(Uttaradit) - avoid, sounds like a dull city, 500k
a few small towns
(Lampung) - mid-size, 750k!, biggest city worth trying for slow pace, has a walkable area
(Lamphun) - mid-size, 400k, second biggest city worth trying for an even slower pace, no walkable area?
