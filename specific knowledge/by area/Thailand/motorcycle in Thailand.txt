how to buy:
http://travelthisearth.com/mount-up-a-guide-to-purchasing-a-motorbike-in-chiang-mai/
  - steps through his personal experience, with pictures of documents (green book, etc.)

https://www.nomadasaurus.com/buying-motorbike-southeast-asia/
  - knows $300 for a bike, but **says $100 local price in Vietnam!**
  - **says motorcycles are more expensive in Laos and Cambodia, plus, the conditions are the worst there; So, it’s best to buy from Vietnam or Thailand.**
  - **says it’s easier to cross borders with a motorcycle that has a license plate from Vietnam. I think the same would apply for Thailand (Thailand also being more wealthy than it’s neighbors.**

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/1126335-used-motorcycles-through-a-chiang-mai-dealer-honda-msx-or-kawasaki-ksr/#comments
  - says to go to the Land Registration Office together to transfer, and only pay after it is transferred

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/1138186-bikes-no-green-book/page/2/#comments
  - basically, if you don’t have the green book, you can’t tax nor insure it
  - in order to register it, you must pay tax for all of the past time!
  - didn’t go completely through it...

resident certificate:
needed in order to transfer or get a Thai driver’s license



https://www.expatden.com/thailand/change-your-address-samut-prakan/
  - a very similar process. includes TM28 and TM30 samples, and even a resident certificate sample

https://www.tielandtothailand.com/certificate-residency/
  - great post, alt. to expatden

https://th.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/notaries-public/
  - i read that it’s possible to get a resident certificate equivalent from the embassy. i believe it comes in the form of an affidavit, a blank affidavit specifically. but, kr coats $50 for notarized anything from the embassy. (much cheaper—free!—to get it through Siam’s gov)

digital market-places:
**Kaidee**
  - Thai-language classifieds
**Facebook market-place**
  - probably the most used classifieds
  - must change Facebook location in order to use it
Bahtsold
  - a digital classifieds for motorcycles, cars, property, etc.
ExpatDen
  - has a classifieds section
ThaiVisa
  - has a classifieds section
https://www.motors.co.th/en/bikes/secondhand/Chiang-Mai
  - 12 motorcycles listed
https://www.expat.com/en/classifieds/asia/thailand/chiang-mai/motorbikes.html
  - 3 motorcycles listed

Facebook groups
  - Chiang Mai
    - https://m.facebook.com/groups/512883258737603/

rental shops:
Chloe Motorbike Rentals
  - extremely good and new bikes with very fair prices at 2000-3000baht depending on the model
**Bamboo Bikes**
  - chill English / Aussie people
  - 2000baht for a Fino or an old Click, but, can be haggled
Chiang Mai Scooter Rental
  - perfect Google reviews, and, very responsive on Facebook
  - 2000 for a Fino, more for better automatics

prices:
motorcycleinth.com
  - very good to see retail prices of each model made in Thailand

can probably use Philippines classifieds for a general used motorcycle price (since they use English)


generally:
$100 is the lowest price, great for less popular brands
$200 is still a good price
$300 perhaps should buy one in good condition

kinds of motorcycles:
see main wikipedia article for motorcycle

small *under-bone* *step-through* motorcycles
  - Honda Dream 110/125, Honda Wave 110/125, and generally most motorcycles beneath 150cc in Southeast Asia
  - **these are the most popular motorcycles in Southeast Asia**, so, it’s **the easiest to repair**
  - unlike the Cub, ***some* of these don’t come with a wind-shield for the bottom half of the body.** Legs *will* get dirty. Also, the seating might not be as up-right as the Cub
  - **most of these are rather boring to ride, save the Suzukis and 2-strokers**
**sporty *under-bone* motorcycles**
  - Honda Nova Sonic, Suzuki Raider, Yamaha X-1(?)
  - manual (except the step-through Kawasaki KSR125)
  - not full-on racing-position racing, but just more sporty. The seating range from racing to up-right, along with the pedals’ placements and the type of pedal (single lever, or step-through style) .
  - **often sacrifices a flat seat and a rear-rack compared to cubs and touring motorcycles, also: seat space, and a seat storage compartment**, though it’s no different from the standard under-bone motorcycles...
  - these are more fun, and offers full control (via fully manual gearbox) than the normal small motorcycles
  - these also often start with way better features: disc brakes, alloy wheels, bigger tires, etc.
**city** / small commuter
  - Honda Cub, Dream 100, and Wave 100
  - **if you can’t get a touring motorcycle, or, if you simply want a smaller size motorcycle that is easy to get around city streets, this is the way to go. It’s also just always nice to have a Cub for every-day use, as it’s the most economic (in fuel economy, but more importantly, in cost to repair!)** (todo: haven’t really researched fuel economy...)
  - quite light-weight, easy to move around
standard / **commuter** / touring
  - Honda CB(F) series, Kawasaki CT100, Suzuki GD110, Yamaha YBR
  - **if you only have one motorcycle, let it be this kind**
  - it also has twice the fuel-capacity of under-bone motorcycles, with 10+L instead of 4-5L
  - it often is 125cc instead of 100cc
**trail**
  - Honda CT110
  - **a very compelling small-sized all-rounder, going where the Cub can’t go, but retaining the bicycle-like handling**

other kinds:
cruiser
  - Honda Phantom, Harley, etc.
  - usually big (200cc+), **heavy (150kg)**, with a very lazy seating style. It doesn’t seem practical, as there’s often little room for luggage.
mini-bike
  - Honda MSX, KSR110 GPX Demon
  - seems interesting... but, **like other sports bikes, it just doesn’t have the seat-space and balance that touring motorcycles and cubs do, making it less practical**
street-racing / dirt
  - Honda Nova Tena/Dash, Kawasaki KLX series
  - **light-weight (75kg)**, aerodynamic, barebones, **often 2-stroke engine that makes a whiny noise and emits smoke**. **But, if you can find one that isn’t so whiny, it could beat the city motorcycles in being the best city bike!**
  - https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/859511-thai-visa-2-stroke-gurus/
racing (proper)
  - Honda CBR series, Kawasaki KSR
  - aerodynamic seating position, so, probably not comfortable for touring *or* city-use: in other words, **they’re useless for travelers**
business
  - CB150-like motorcycles specially modified to be rickshaws or carrying gas tanks every-day


classes:
the class is about the displacement of the motorcycle

100cc
  - 70-100kg (large variation, todo: worth knowing which motorcycles are lighter, with less extraneous plastic)
  - great for cities, but can be tiring for long distances
  - cub 100, dream / wave 100
  - **rides at 40km/h optimally, which is the perfect feeling for me**, can become shaky after 50km/h
110cc-115cc
  - 90-100kg
  - great compromise, jack-of-all-trades
  - dream / wave 110, sonic, x-1, smash, shooter
  - goes to 50-60km/h comfortably, then just feels uncomfortable faster than that
125cc
  - 105-110kg
  - from this size and on, it can feel a bit large and heavy, making it *feel* less fun and more cruiser-like (read: life-less)
  - 110kg+
  - at this point, a clutch likely replaces the step-through

engines:
2-stroke
  - **often emits smoke**, which i *loathe* from others; it emits smoke because gasoline and oil is often mixed, burning the oil away
  - **mixing oil and gas adds an extra step of maintenance and chance of a problem occurring**, yet, there are less engine parts and thus less things to fail...
  - **often makes a whiny noise**
  - less fuel efficient, because one must rev at a higher RPM to keep moving
  - used on street racing motorcycles, which can easily be modded, abused, and discarded
  - **great classic 2-stroke motorcycles can be found for cheap in SE Asia!** and **at half the price of a 4-stroke!!**

**4-stroke**
  - generally cleaner, more reliable, and longer lasting

models:
https://www.cyclechaos.com/
  - a motorcycle wiki

mototh.com
  - contains a picture and specs of some of the most popular motorcycles in Thailand, but, far from complete

https://anotherlookatvietnam.blogspot.com/2013/05/two-strokes-and-their-stories.html?showComment=1586461762512#c4078832331179813749
  - this post covers many 2 strokes with a bit of cultural history! Suzuki Crystal, RGV, Nova, etc.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Honda_engines#Motorcycle,_ATV_and_watercraft
  - these engine wiki lists are quite comprehensive, as many models use such few engines

Honda Cub (and it’s many variants)
  - main line: C100EX, C100, C90, C86, C70, C50
    - I think the C70’s style is the one that recent “retro” clones imitate
C70
  - really old, but the frame is really vintage-feeling, full of steel decor
  - **these old cub engines are probably too old and weak in comparison to more current cubs**
**Dream 100** (C100EX, 1986+)
  - **the main cub in Thailand, perhaps the most popular, practical, and reliable motorcycle in Thailand**
  - I tested an old one at the motorcycle shop. It **felt it ran well at 40km/h, and feels great before then too.** That particular one had an engine running rather loud, and, with it’s shakiness, I think it would have gotten tiring riding after long periods of time.
  - 94kg, 3.7L, 6kw/8nm
**Dream 110i** (2011+)
  - replaced the Dream 125
  - **the main 110-125cc class cub and motorcycle in Thailand**
  - 100kg, 4.3L, only slightly (0.5) more torque/power: 8.5nm
Dream 125
  - I tried an old one at the shop. **It feels bigger than the Dream 100, more like the Yamaha Spark (115), built for a more comfortable ride, which meant it didn’t feel fun. It felt very standard, plain, without feeling, and plasticky.**
Wave 100
  - adds option for front disc brake
  - someone on the forums said the Wave Z was great, then they dropped in quality
Wave 125?

non-Honda cubs:
**are there really no 4-stroke cubs?**
Suzuki RC100
  - 2-stroke, perhaps more recent than the FR series, perhaps to compete with the Dream
Suzuki FR series
  - 2-stroke, like a Yamaha Mate
  - perhaps equally as legendary as the Yamaha Mate, just less popular, except, perhaps, in Vietnam!
Yamaha Y series (Mate)
  - 2-stroke
  - **i thought these were annoying as old ladies in Taiwan drove them, not caring about either the smoke or noise**
  - yet, these are equally as legendary as the original Honda Cubs, even often out-lasting them!
 smaller makers: Sanyang Jinwah (Taiwan), Ryuku Classic (China), Tiger Retro (Thailand)
  - just depend on trusting the maker’s quality
Kawasaki Max 100
  - ~1986, not sure if 2-stroke or 4-stroke


Kawasaki:
generally makes bigger motorcycles, 200cc and higher. They stopped making *step-throughs* in Thailand
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kawasaki_motorcycles

in production:
**W175** (or higher, of the W series)
  - recent retro-style commuter bike made for the Asian market
  - **although in a different class from the Suzuki GD 110, this is surely one of the best practical motorcycles**
KLX150 (or higher, of the KLX series)
  - 150cc on-and-off-road (“dual-purpose) bike
D-Tracker (normal and X versions)
  - looks just like the KLX150, perhaps same engine, but with bigger tires
Z110 (maybe also KSR110?)
  - a “mini-bike” quite different from the rest of the Z series
  - **clutch-less!,** which is quite rare for racing bikes, and especially from Kawasaki
  - still, it doesn’t have any seat space, and, it has a more ATV-like seating position; the sporty under-bones are a much better choice than this and it’s Thai copy (the GPX Demon)
KLX110 / KLX140
  - are tiny dirt-bikes, quite different from the KLX150 and higher

old / out-of-production:
**CT100**
  - entry-level touring motorcycle, competes with the GD110
**GTO**
  - a touring 2-stroke motorcycle, 1990+
  - **considered second best 2-stroke after the Yamaha RX series**
  - m4 (mach 4) version?

Leo
  - a street racer like the Honda Nova Tena
Cosmo
  - 105cc, between Suzuki Sport and Suzuki Crystal
Boss
  - 175cc, touring or cruiser?

old semi-auto under-bones:
listed from old to new
ref: https://pantip.com/topic/32180951

Joy
  - the oldest, 50cc(?) cub
AX-4
  - ancient cub
**MAX100**
  - a fat lookin’ cub, 4-stroke

**Cheer**
  - predecessor of Kaze, manual
**Kaze** Hit
  - old under-bone model for Asia, 112cc
  - at **31k** seems like a steal, being a high-quality under-bone
  - **this might also be a manual transmission
    - if this is the case, I’d think it’s better to just go with a sporty under-bone instead. Nonetheless, it’s an interesting alternative to the boring standard under-bones, and still surely a great deal**
Kaze ZX130R
  - disc-brakes, optional alloy wheels
  - at **42k** also seems like a steal for a 130cc from a top-brand
  - **probably the best deal for a powerful standard-style under-bone**. The Spark / Jupiter 130 may be it’s only competition, yet this is much cheaper!
ref:

Neon
  - 2-stroke
Magic
  - 2-stroke


Suzuki:
**the Mazda of motorcycles: *fun*, *quick*, *tighter* (rougher suspension), yet still for every-day use, and still high-quality too.** That could mean it may be tiring for long-distance riding. Many of the models come with features (disc brakes) standard! Most of the models feel lighter and smaller than their Honda equivalents, and *much* smaller (and much more fun) than their Yamaha equivalents.

**Smash** (110cc, now 115cc) 
  - **much more fun, responsive than it’s competition; I prefer it over Honda and Yamaha**
  - seems a little more high-pitched, antsy, but it may have just been the settings
  - 93-95kg is a good weight for it’s class
  - 7kw/9nm
Shooter (115cc, replaced by Smash 115cc)
  - same power as the Smash, biggest difference is that this is **fuel-injected** (at least in the new version they are!)
  - 100kg
  - **possible upgrade to alloy (“mag”) wheels, which comes with front disc brakes**
  - actually feels between a 100cc and a 125cc, quite comfortable, like a Yamaha Spark but with a bit more spunk, tactile shifting
  - I tried this at the shop. **It runs really well. It feels extremely *capable* compared to the 100cc motorcycles. It easily can do 60+km. Compared to the [Yamaha] Spark, it accelerates faster**, just as the 100cc Suzuki out-accelerated the others in it’s class.
**Shogun** (125cc)
  - **this would probably be my choice for a standard under-bone motorcycle (like a Honda Wave)**. I don’t think the seat is as up-right as a cub, nor does it have the steel metal rack behind it... but, it’s way cooler than the rest!
  - I’ve only sat on this, and it feels quite small for a 125, which is great!
  - 110kg
  - **front *and* rear disc brakes!** standard
Best (110/125/130cc?)
  - basically a Shooter or Shogun or special 130cc
  - fully manual / clutch on the 130cc; the rest seem semi-auto
**Raider (150cc)**
  - still only 110kg
  - **very special, perhaps most powerful for it’s size**
  - front and rear disc brakes standard
  - re-released, fuel-injected now

**GD110**
  - **a very special *small-with-big-feel* motorcycle** with only new small company rivals now coming out (Lifan, Ryuka, etc.)
  - cluth / fully manual
  - looks fantastic, plus, top Japanese quality
  - keeps all old-style features: drum brakes, carburetor, etc.
  - only 35K new, 15-25K like new

TU250/ST250
  - “Variations of the bike marketed in the JDM and other regions include the VanVan (Asia, Europe), Grasstracker (TU250G)(Asia), Grasstracker Bigboy (TU250GB)(Asia) and Volty (Asia, Europe).
  - in Thailand, VanVan is being used

GZ series (125, 250, etc.)
  - a more cruiser posture of the GN/GD

old:
4-stroke cub clones
  - **FB100, FB80, FB50**

classics:
4 stroke:
**GS 125 (CB125 competition), GS series, GN, ST, GZ, etc.**
  - the original motorcycles that are now being re-produced
  - GN is the standard

2 stroke:
A series (A100, A80, GP100, AX100, etc.)
  - classic 2-stroke touring bike from the late 60’s to 70s!
  - GP100 and AX100 are the latest versions, perhaps m the 90s
TS series (TS100, TS125, etc.)
  - the off-road version of the A-series
  - i think stands for trail, since the front suspension is much longer, and the exhaust goes upward

GT250
  - http://www.suzukicycles.org/GT-series/GT250.shtml
  - a powerful 30+ hp twin 2-stroke engine!
    - it surely must scream

classic ricers (~110cc sporty 2-stroke street bikes):
**Crystal**
RG Sport
RGV 120

Yamaha:
the other standard. Like Honda, it just seems to be aiming for comfort and boring-ness, as Japanese culture tends to do. It’s the opposite of Suzuki, creating a spectrum of plastic dullness (Yamaha) to fun and tactile (Suzuki), with Honda in the middle. Very much like the Toyota, Honda, Mazda spectrum for cars (Yamaha being Toyota: utterly boring).
Spark (115cc, aka T115)
  - pretty comfortable ride (not talking about the seat’s comfort), very tactile shifting, very slow response (feels like driving an automatic)
  - feels like a Dream 110 in size (95kg), yet it feels like an entire class more powerful! way better than the Honda motorcycles in it’s class (or at-least the old ones that I tried)
  - feels larger, *smoother*, especially shifting; feels like a cruiser, thus: it also feels *boring*, dull
  - **it felt somewhere between the Suzuki Shooter and the 100cc motorcycles. It feels *feels* slower to accelerate than the Suzukis. Perhaps the gearing is just that way.**
Spark 135 (T135, aka Jupiter, Sniper, etc.)
  - 135cc is 110kg
  - there’s a long thaivisa thread on this... see refs: it’s quite special without a rival (except the now out-of-production Kawasaki Kaze ZX130)
**X-1** (110cc)
  - **seems to be a goldilocks median, like the Honda Sonic: light-weight (95kg), yet powerful, with good features (disc brakes, etc.)**
  - yet, **people generally say it still the same plasticky Yamaha feel to it: lifeless. Though, this and the X-1R are probably the the only things that Yamaha has made that approaches being fun.**
**X-1R** (135cc)
  - 105-110kg
  - the body of this seems larger than the Sonic
  - the same engine as T135, just with a few changes

proper motorcycles:
**XSR155**
  - commuter bike,
SR series (SR125, SR150, etc.)
  - proper retro-style motorcycle
  - SR150
    - special Taiwan continued production and update of the SR125
    - sounds quite loud

**RX (RX 100, RX-S 115, RX 135, RX-Z 135)**
  - **classic 2-stroke, considered one of the best, if not the best, especially the 115, along with Kawasaki GTO**

oldies:
YL1
  - 1960s classic 2-stroke, looks beautiful!
YL2
  - “trail master”, 2-stroke
YB100
  - early 50cc(?) 4-stroke, looks like the 2-stroke RX, and even has pedals that double as pegs! lol


**YBR125 or YGR125?**
  - retro classic, more modernized appearance, like the contemporary Suzuki GD and re-newed Honda CB series

old:
Fresh II
  - http://mototh.com/en/bike/70/Yamaha+Fresh+II
  - regular 4-stroke step-through...

Yamaha DT
  - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DT
    - very old, perhaps first *dual-purpose* / *scrambler* (2-stroke) motorcycle: for road and off-road


Honda:
the standard. **High re-sale value means higher cost. Better to buy an old motorcycle that isn’t a Honda and keep it.** The Cub is great, but, beyond that, I feel is quite sterile, boring.
**Dream 100 (C100)**
  - a Honda Cub C100 beneath
Dream 110 (ND110)
  - I *feel* this is the perfect balance for size and power
  - But, unfortunately, Honda’s 110cc seems quite boring... I’ll have to try more motorcycles though
Dream 125 (ND125)
  - feels quite larger than the Cub
Wave (100/110/125)
  - i’m not really sure what the difference between the Dreams and the Waves are... Maybe the Waves just have newer engines...

Hunter Cubs:
CT90
CT110
  - 1980-2008, used in Australia by the postal service

(Nova) Cela
  - https://pantip.com/topic/39150455
  - made once in 1990, 2-stroke
Nova Tena
  - small street racing bike, 2-stroke
Nova Dash
  - a more poweful (130cc?) 2-stroke street racing bike

Dream II
  - Suzuki Crystal rival, but way more expensive during it’s time (1980s?)
**Nova Sonic** (125cc/150cc, RS / RS Super)
  - **a beloved goldilocks: small-size feeling, *nimble*, yet 125cc-like power with extra features standard**
  - front and back disc brakes?
  - this was **my first love**: low-seat, more up-right than the average scooter (except the cub), great display, great turning, small slender body. Only problem is that there is no space for a basket nor a rack in the back. You would need to have a back-pack, and fit a small backpack in front(?). Also, need to learn to use clutch.


CB125
  - CG125, CM125, CD125, (GL125?), etc.
  - classic commuter motorcycle
CG125
  - CB, but continued development in poorer countries, making it require less maintenance
  - perhaps the best pop safe-bet choice for a touring bike
  - **but now, even this is quite old...**, and anything newer, including the Suzuki GD110 is way more powerful
**Master**
  - commuter motorcycle

smaller companies:
SYM (Taiwan)
**Wolf**
  - legendary commuter motorcycle

Centaur (Thailand):
this company seems to have a better reputation than the others (thinking of Tiger and Ryuka)
**Stallion (150/250/...)**
  - a touring motorcycle with a beautiful retro appearance
  - the 150 version comes in several pop retro styles, with lower seating, lower handle-bars, etc.
  - **generally, it these kinds of motorcycles seems like a good alternative to a now very old Honda CB motorcycle. Hopefully they use similar parts so they can be repaired anywhere in Southeast Asia.**

GPX (Thailand)
**Legend**
  - retro touring motorcycle.
Demon
  - Honda MSX local clone, quite popular with the boys here
  - **feels great to sit on, like a yoga ball**; But: **there’s no room for carrying cargo**, thus, it’s useless

Tiger (Thailand):
*need to do more research on the quality of these...*
TT150
  - retro touring motorcycle, similar to a Honda CB150
? (name?)
  - retro cub, similar to the Honda c70, but with a 100cc engine

Ryuka (Chinese, Zongshen):
*really would need to research on the quality of these...*
?
  - Classic
    - a Honda Cub clone with a 100cc engine
    - only costs about 20-30K new!
  - **Retro**
    - maybe a competitor to the Suzuki GD110!

Lifan (Chinese)
*this company might just have worse reviews than Ryuka!*: https://www.bikechatforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=184773
  - **LF125**
    - at least I think that’s what it was...
    - **quite a unique small full-bike (with clutch, not an under-bone), perhaps like a Suzuki GD110. I felt this motorcycle was a really good size and even lighter, much lighter than the typical Honda MSX and much much lighter than a GPX demon, with a long seat, and quite up-right, even more up-right than the average scooter!**


prices:
main:

**15k is a good deal for a like new Suzuki GD 110**
**10k is a good spot for a good condition small motorcycle (100cc Honda, 110-125cc Suzuki) with about 20k miles**
**5-7.5k is a good price for a good condition motorcycle with 20-50k miles**
3k is a steal, other-wise, just something really old, or stolen
1.5k is junk-yard motorcycles used for spare parts
  - probably not worth it, as it probably may need some money for various small repairs, even if the engine is running

3k-8k
  - **classic 2-stroke motorcycles**
    - this is an extremely interesting choice...


others:
automatics:
th$2000/month to rent an automatic scooter (Mio/GT125/Click, $1500 to rent a Fino)
th$6,000 2007 Yamaha Mio
th$10,000 2012 Yamaha Mio, Yamaha Fino... a good price point
th$45,000 new Yamaha GT125, Honda Scoopy, Yamaha Fino 115 (the Click is now ridiculously expensive)
-


so, what to get?
a cheap-o 100cc standard under-bone

a 4-stroke 100cc *cub*
  - Honda Dream 100, Honda Wave 100?, etc. all likely fine, especially those that use the C100(EX) engines
  - **remember: the only motorcycle you’ve bought was a cub clone, and that lasted *years***

a  4-stroke 125cc+ *commuter* / small motorcycle
  - Suzuki GD 110, Suzuki AX4, Kawasaki W175, Kawasaki D-Tracker, Yamaha XSR155

a 4-stroke 125-150cc *sporty under-bone* motorcycle
  - Honda Nova Sonic, Suzuki Raider 

**the cub is for every-day commutes, as it has the most potential for every-day practical uses
the small *commuter* motorcycle is an all-around touring bike which can cover both every-day commutes *and* touring, just as a touring bicycle could; it can even replace the cub as the first motorcycle
the sporty under-bone is a secondary (replacing the cub) or tertiary bike, for it’s quick, light-weight, nimble-ness, and fun
an alternative to the sporty under-bone may just be a good hybrid bicycle!**

get a cheap cub first (or an equally cheap sporty under-bone, if it pops up)
or, if you can’t find that, just get a like new Suzuki GD 110
or, if you don’t have money, get a like new recent cub (Dream 100)

how to search:
filters:
nearby
  - for the first motorcycle, so you can walk to bike to it
maximum price 10k
  - 10k is a good number
  - can first search 3k then work your way up to 10k, looking for steals; just look for something in good condition, well kept, just sitting at home
brand
  - could look for less popular brands first: Kawasaki, then Suzuki

first search for less popular steals
then, enter the big names


what I would buy:
Kawasaki
  - **W175**
  - KLX150
  - D-Tracker

Suzuki
  - **Raider**
    - fastest under-bone; I’d prefer this over the Sonic
  - **GD 110**
    - my favorite and most desired motorcycle
  - **AX4**
    - basically a GD 150; the difference in power / torque is huge!
    - along with the GD 110 as my most desired motorcycle
  - Van Van

Yamaha:
XSR155

solid models:
Honda
  - Nova Sonic (125/150 aka RS/RS Super)
  - **Dream 100** (C100, C100N)
    - currently produced cub
  - **Dream 110**



possible steals:
any old 4-stroke touring motorcycle
  - Honda CG, Honda JX, Suzuki X-4?, etc.

cheap-o un-popular branded under-bones:
Kawasaki:
Cheer
Kaze (Hit)
Kaze ZX130

Suzuki:
nearly all Suzukis are steals
  - Smash (/Best 110)
  - Shooter
  - Shogun (/Best 125)

  - a very good opinionated post about 40 motorcycle in Vietnam. He understands that Suzukis are fun, Hondas are boring, and Yamahas can fall off. He mentions the legendary SYM Wolf, and a similar Honda Master.


https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/122334-suzuki-best-vs-suzuki-raider-vs-yamaha-x1r/
  - the OP has come to a similar conclusion as I have: wanting a small sporty bike to get around the city: he narrowed it down to the Suzuki Best (Super Best 125cc version) and the Suzuki Raider (150cc)
  - another person mentions that the Honda CBR (and **racing bikes in general) is meant for racing around a track, as opposed to city driving, which requires easy turning**

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/371255-yamaha-spark-rx-135i-vs-honda-wave-125i/
  - a good tiny one page discussion of OP wanting the power of the Spark 135 and the practicality of the Wave
  - Spark RX 135i seems to have an up-right seat similar to the Wave, but without any storage space (likely due to the engine being bigger), though, neither does any of it’s competition
  - other people point out that **the Raider 150, Sonic 125, and Kawasaki ZX130 are in the same league as the Spark 135**.
  - the Raider is exceptional in that it has rear disc brakes (in addition to it’s more powerful engine)
  - someone else points out that the Raider went out of production because it didn’t pass new emission laws, and that Kawasaki doesn’t produce under-bones at all anymore

https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/798728-yamaha-exciter-150-aka-spark-sniper-jupiter/page/4/#comments
  - big discussion, started at page 3, haven’t got to the end
  - Spark / Jupiter 150... “lots of torque, free reving motor, very light clutch, great engine sound, feels secure around the bends and overall a fun bike for the city. Negatives would be no storage and small fuel tank.”
  - somebody said they had a Sonic for two years as an every-day motorcycle, and the only problem is that there isn’t enough storage space for multi-day trips. Also, putting a basket in front of it (or the Raider) would be dangerous.
    - I wonder: why not just travel with a backpack?
  - “I was fairly happy with the spark 135, but this bike resolves all drawbacks of that bike.
Tubeless. (#2)
Bigger / wider tires. (#2)
Manual clutch allows better control, smother shifting. (#1)
1 gear more. (#3)”
  - a few people note how cheap the displays are (especially compared to Honda) and how bad the front suspension fork is (though it’s a general problem for fat people on small bikes)

some video
  - the Raider 150 is the size of a Sonic! (tiny!!) The Spark 135 is like any other fat scooter like motorcycle (Wave 125, etc.)
