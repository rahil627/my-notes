buy a bowl of rice and put it into metal tin
  - keep a bottle of soy sauce on you
  - should be **th$20 for 500g of rice!?!?** (not cooked)

street snacks:
near the airport:
th$10-30 for snacks
  - th$10 for sticky rice wrapped in a leaf
  - th$20 for cooked sweet potatoes

visas:

  - extremely good, straight-forward info

(Thailand:)
30 days visa-exempt.

**A new rule exists now: can’t *immediately* enter Thailand via land border crossing twice (or thrice?). So, either have to book a flight back, or, stay a week in the other country, or, get a tourist visa.**

There are 60-day single-entry visas ($40 + possibly saved passport stamp space?). Have to fetch it from a nearby country’s embassy, but maybe have to begin the process online? It takes a few days to process.

There are various visas for 90-day single ($80 + saved passport space) and optional multiple-entry ($200), but, they require a bit of paper-work to get. Some ways seem okay: media (film-producer) and study. Something to look into once one is secure and plan to stay only in Thailand.

After scoring a tourist visa, or, finding the cheapest flight into Thailand, then, it’s best to find a way to get an actual visa, which last one-year. There are volunteer visas, and school visas (for language study?, and surely otherwise). But... after that... then what? Maybe knowing the language will give me points with immigration?

Land border crossings to Cambodia are generally sketchy ($30-35 *with US$ bills*). Crossings to Laos are better but have varying visa costs. Crossing to Malsysia is best, albeit far.

Cambodia
  - full of scams, several kinds, on both sides, at several border crossings
  - us$ bills required to get best rate ($30)

Laos:
There are visas on arrival (th$1200-1500/$30-51, better with US$ bills) and e-visas ($30-100) to Laos. Wikitravel notes e-visa prices can be random and higher than visa-on-arrival, and, has a “special line” which can be slower, but, it could save a passport page.

Myanmar:
There’s also crossings to Myanmar, in which you get a day-visa for th$500 and just walk back the same day (then it’s ~$8/day stay in Myamar).

Malaysia
Luckily, there’s even one crossing via train(!!!) to Malaysia; So, can either fly (Air Asia or Nok Air) or train out ‘n in. Plus, Malaysia’s visa-exempt (free) and for 90 days. This also might save passport space.

conclusion:
Either do the day-trip to Myanmar, or, go to Malaysia. Plan early. Buy a flight early, maybe only $20 one-way (less than the cost of most visas). This also might save passport space. Keep the Myanmar option as a last-minute backup; Try to avoid using up the land-border visa runs though.

It might be possible to just camp around Malaysia for a week, before returning to Thailand by land. Sleep around small train stations?

transport for visa runs:
remember: must fly-in to avoid counting as an over-land visa run

trains:
$pennies on the Thailand side
$? on the Malaysian side

flights:
$20 for any national flight
$15-$30 for any flight between Malaysia and Thailand via Air Asia (because it’s headquartered there)
  - ~$30 from/to Chiang Mai
  - ~$15 from/to southern Thailand
  - low-cost Malaysian airports include Penang (George Town), Kuala Lumpur, and Kota Bahru (Kelantan!). Best to just go to the border and train back, or, if you have money, make a trip in Kelantan! Just hitch-hike around.

thai language wiki
  - mostly made up of 4 ancient languages: Pali, Mon, Sanskrit, Old Khmer!

travel info:
see life documentation folder

https://www.travelfish.org/alldestinations/thailand
  - many brief writings on towns, ratings for each, of most areas in Thailand
  - they seem to prefer remote, warm-hearted quaint places
  - good to add some destinations

thoughts on a trip from Bangkok to Chiang Mai
https://www.travelfish.org/trip_planner/stops-between-bangkok-and-chiang-mai
  - great, blunt “slow” travel info

I think its best to simply stop by tiny towns and sleep at the train station. The more rural, the better. But, perhaps, best not to have money on me...

I *feel* that is the best because with such a heavy back-pack (plus two more bags!!), it would be difficult to travel without a motorcycle: it would involve finding a hostel, getting there: meaning, finding bus stations and catching buses, staying the night, forced to trip during the day, then forced to stay another night, because I *want* to travel (move) during the day. So, I would have to spend two nights in every place that I stop, or, one night, and I just keep moving and bussing.

Compare that to motorcycling. **With a motorcycle, I am *free*.**

**The next best thing to a motorcycle is the train. With a train, at least, you can stop whenever and wherever you want**, and just catch the next train, going at your own pace, letting the train move you, and allowing more time in the mind.

So, just check the maps to see what little train station towns are on the way, and make your own little town trip.

towns on the way
(Bangkok)
Ayuthaya
  - right next to the train station!
small towns: Tha Rua, Ban Mo
(Lop Buri) - 750k!, can skip
a ton of small towns
(Phitsanoluk) - avoid, sounds like a dull transit hub
a few small towns
(Uttaradit) - avoid, sounds like a dull city, 500k
a few small towns
(Lampung) - mid-size, 750k!, biggest city worth trying for slow pace, has a walkable area
(Lamphun) - mid-size, 400k, second biggest city worth trying for an even slower pace, no walkable area?
