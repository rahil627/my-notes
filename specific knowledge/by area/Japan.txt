Japan

cheap food:
convenient store
$1 for all of these
  - frozen foods
    - **fried rice, and other rice mixes**, this is the best convenient store deal for something satisfying to the body
  - tortilla (corn) chips
  - candied sweet potato (yam?) fries
  - white bread
    - two kinds: one better than the other
  - beer / alcohol

grocery:
  - **root veggies** (carrots, potatoes, yams, taros, radishes, etc.), often a whole bag of veggies for $1

hitch-hike:
rural roads
more south, better chances
avoid hitch-hiking in cities
  - use train in Kansai area, very affordable
  - not worth hitch-hiking short distances
    - use buses for shorter distances
use service areas and parking areas to hitch-hike long distance on the main developed side

survival:
some convenient stores are much better than others, providing chairs, a desk, and electrical sockets
most convenient stores remove their chairs at night, and, most clerks don’t *want* people to sleep in there
the chairs are uncomfortable, prolonged sitting leads blood to the feet, even when one’s legs are up
