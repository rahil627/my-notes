< Can you rent PO Boxes in Taiwan?
<
< Thanks I just went and did it. There were about 7 forms to fill out. Lucky for me they had a volunteer < that helped me fill the forms in.
<
< It cost NT$300 for the rental, and a deposit of NT$400. Needed 2 forms of photo ID and my chops.
<
< They gave me about 10 different Box numbers to choose from, so availability did not seem to be a problem.
