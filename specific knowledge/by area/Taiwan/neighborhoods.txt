    - WenHua?
    - Guting?
    - NTNU, Longquan st, lots of boutiques catered to upper class kids, and cafes, some resident areas, some large apartments
    - NTU, has an okay night market, very pretty residential housing in some areas, near NTU which is a place I may study at, but definite not necessary
    - what do I want? A traditional area. A residential area. A day market. 60NTD buffet. No commercial stores.
    - x/Yonghe/Zhonghe, dense Asian city area, not special, not as green as Taipei? Perhaps need to stroll through more neighborhoods
    - Sanchong, Luzhou, get equally bad rep as Yonghe
