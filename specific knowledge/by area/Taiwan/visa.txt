Taiwan visa

http://www.taadc.com/visas/student-visas-in-taiwan:
1) Apply for admission to an accredited Mandarin Language Training Center in Taiwan (often this is still done via physical mail, not online)
2) Receive your acceptance letter from said Center
3) Go to your nearest Taiwanese Embassy, Consulate, or Representative Office to apply for a Visitor Visa.

It's better to get a working visa first and sign up for classes rather than the other way around.

  - I also wouldn't want to look for work online. I'd rather meet people and crate work, freelance, or join good people. I'll worry about this later.
  - it requires an approval letter issued by the Council of Labor affairs
