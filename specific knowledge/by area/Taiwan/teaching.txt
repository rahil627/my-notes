Modawei, Cortland, and most of the Tomcat schools (but not all franchises) pay new teachers $600/hour during training, and $900/hour for teaching.

If you're a hardcore teacher, the lack of benefits, respect, & support won't surprise or bother you. It's worth the relative teaching freedom (outside of the McChains) you usually get to innovate. So for me, the "best" schools are the relatively crap schools that have no ready-made lessons plans, a crappy curriculum, & low standards... with the freedom to improve on them. It's paid self-training for turning crap into results.

Ditch the agent and just walk around train stations and MRT stops, etc.. I'm sure other people can tell you where the bigger concentration of schools are located in Taipei, but the main point is to just go in there and talk to them. Most of them will lie to you and try to jerk you around. Don't believe too much of what really anyone tells you.. especially the agents.

If you are a first timer, HESS and Shane or Ko Jen or another big franchise school will be your best option. If you want to live in Taipei, but are willing to commute, you can get jobs in Xindian, Banqiao, Taoyuan City, or even Sanxia. But certainly avoid a school called "Uncle Sam." They are the worst. Also avoid Dewey, they suck hard. Dewey is a recruiter, BTW.

IMHO, the best place for saving money (for the average EFLer with a BA or BSc only) amongst the four you mentioned is South Korea. The downside is that you have to live in S. Korea. If I were to rank the four STRICTLY by pay & perks, I would do so as such: 1. S. Korea 2. Taiwan & Japan (for non-JET teachers) roughly on a par 3. China.

No, Taiwan will never have its own “JET”. The county education bureaus don’t even want to touch NSTs with a barge pole. So they contract out private firms to manage the barbarians. It leads to a cluster****. For example, in my county alone, there are three separate outfits representing the various schools!
