a government-as-patron-of-the-arts scene where the local and national governments support artists as a vehicle for economic development, and an underground scene of talented people expressing themselves for expression’s sake. Of the latter, Zhongxin Market is worth a visit. Located a stone’s throw from the Museum of Fine Arts, this slightly dilapidated hangar-esque  building has workshops, cafes, bookshops, antique stores, and even a small shrine. For me it evoked memories of the now-defunct Kunsthaus Tacheles in Berlin. Let’s hope the inhabitants of Zhongxin don’t get similarly booted in the name of urban beautification.



http://laorencha.blogspot.tw/2014/09/reason-i-forgot-to-love-taiwan-taipei.html:
One reason I love living in Taipei (Taipei specifically, although the rest of Taiwan is not bad in this regard either) is that they have largely avoided the urban planning mistakes of much of the USA, which China is now falling prey to. It's the same reason why, when I was a resident of the country of my citizenship, I enjoyed living in Arlington, Virginia.
  - very interesting…

Basically, I have seen with my own eyes how Beijing was transformed, in a generation, from a city of interconnected, pedestrian-and-bike friendly hutongs connected by roads with bike lanes and dotted with historical sites and squares into a smoggy hellscape of massive ring roads, six-lane highways (downtown, even!) with unpleasant sidewalks if they existed at all and no more bike lanes. The old hutongs were either torn town for glass-and-steel monstrosities that soared into the gray-brown smog above, leaving little space for street-level development, or turned into ersatz up-market "hutongs" dotted with tourist shops replacing the erstwhile real deal.
 — mmmm

I can't stand American urban planning in America - it's one reason why I left (also: healthcare, and fear for my safety in a country of people packing heat where the streets are not always safe for women. Guns make me feel less safe, not safer) - so obviously I wouldn't want to deal with it in China.
  - good reasons :)

In DC, when I arrived in 1998, they had been talking about the "silver line" to the airport for years already. This was when Taipei's metro was first getting started (that's the year the yellow line opened). In that time, the silver line hadn't even begun construction (no ground was broken while I was in college, nor did it begin when I lived there again from 2004-2006) whereas Taipei's metro grew from an infant into a fiercely competent adult.
  - so true

Taipei residents understand the importance of an interesting, multi-use, well-connected, safe urban core
  - :)

I like that people here understand the life-enhancing importance of convenience, and how sometimes it's worth it to trade space for that convenience. Between having a yard and needing a car to drive to Buy 'N Large, or being able to walk less than a minute to the nearest supermarket and convenience store and restaurant and massage parlor and hardware store, I'll take the latter, and for the most part Taipei residents agree with me. In terms of urban planning, I've found My People.
  - :)

And for thinking "I want...whatever" and being able to walk or bike to whatever it is you want.
  - reality is so close!

I think it really depends on where you live. If you are in the Guting neighborhood, for example, access to the river side parks is very easy.

Do you live in Taipei City proper or are you in New Taipei City? There is a big difference. I take your point about how they are really two parts of one greater metropolis, but as someone who lives in Taipei city proper I very rarely go to New Taipei City and when I do, I am struck by the lack of sidewalks, lack of green space and crowding. 

If you moved from Taichung to New Taipei City then I would agreed that you have downgraded. I'm not so sure about Taipei. Yes, I know its more expensive etc, but that's because it is a much nicer place to live and the city has a lot more money. 
  - more argument for Taipei, and against New Taipei (lol)


Is Taipei's lack of green space really that severe? In the city, you have Da'an Park, the belt of parks north of Minzu road running from Yuanshan, Rongxing park, Kangle park on Nanjing, many neighborhood parks, and special parks like Xianjiyan in Jingmei, Fuzhoushan Park, SiShoushan, and the botanical gardens. Plus a National Park north of the city (Yangming Shan). Taipei's most important green space resource are the riverside parks. The riverside parks near Jingmei, Gongguan, and Wanhua are all very spacious. Is Taichung really all that much better in this regard? I freely admit that I don't know Taichung that well and I have been to some very nice parks there but I don't think Taipei is really that bad. Across the river in New Taipei City is another story...
  - very good argument for Taipei


I’ve lived in Taichung for a few years and myself and family much preferred it over living in Taipei (moved to back to Taipei for work)...a lot cheaper and more space and better climate, less crowded., and plenty of parks for kids. it has its drawbacks but so do Kaohsiung and Taipei!
we lived in a premium area in Taichung beside 1st class parks and residential areas for 1/3rd LESS than what I pay for now in New Taipei City! The kindergartens there are also vastly superior for the price, sunny and open space and affordable bilingual schools. The kindergartens in Taipei area frankly shocked me, some even being located in office buildings or industrial blocks! Many look little better than prisons. Even more expensive kindergartens have no open play space and are overcrowded.
  - taizhong gets flack for poor planning, but still seems ok




http://www.forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=89875&start=250:
Indeed, there is hiking to do, but first, you have to take the MRT/bus to get to Bitan. And that is the sad part. 

The point HH makes is that in Xindian -as in most New Taipei- you do not have the myriad of parks with exercise equipment and other amenities that make community living enjoyable. We used to have a playground in the community, it is gone due to MRT construction and it will not be back. There is no playground for kids in any direction, until you hit the public school in the next MRT stop. There is one small park for taichi/old people to take the sun, and it will be gone soon too. There is no community place to walk the dogs/push a stroller. Very family unfriendly.


Exactly, I'm really referring to the local neighbourhood environment rather than day trips and the like.
We also noticed that playground quietly disappearing, the one on the corner that will now be occupied by the station entrance. The lack of playgrounds is striking compared to Taichung and Kaoshiung (Gaoxiong) (this goes for Taipei city proper aswell as New Taipei city), it seems they don't care for 'young folk' in the 'old city' these days. Every bit of government land is sold off to be built on, you can see the old ministry of Finance training centre on Roosevelt road, they were nice grounds and a rare bit of open space...sold off and being developed right now. Where the Meilida riverside development is was once a green strip of land owned by the Taipei MRT company. There is a private catholic school in San Min area, they used to have nice playing fields for their students now occupied by 10 storey massive buildings, God knows why. There are also roads and new developments starting to encroach on the green farming space towards the river where the circle line will go through.







thinking more about other Taiwan towns:

http://www.studychineseintaiwan.com/Our-Blog-%7C%7C-Study-Tips-and-More/Entry/9-living-in-taiwan/8-what-city-in-taiwan-should-you-study-chinese-at.html
$10,000NT/month (approx $300USD) in Taipei will get you a decent room in a two bedroom apartment whereas $10,000NT/month in Kaohsiung can get you an entire 3 bedroom apartment.
  - **

2. Taipei has cold and damp winters whereas winters in the south are still relatively warm and sunny.
  - *

The transportation problem is made worse by the fact that Taichung is less dense and more spread-out than Kaohsiung and Taipei. To truly get around Taichung, you may need to purchase a scooter.
  - ******, fuck that


http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2014/01/ten-reasons-why-taichung-is-best-city.html
  - lol, anarchy

5. The traffic and parking. In Taipei you need to hire a native guide just to understand the weird array of one-way streets, while in Taichung, we don't even have traffic regulations. In Taipei the law is enforced, creating trouble for everyone. In Taichung we say "Law? What law?" and gaily run red lights and park wherever we want. Ever tried to park your car in Taipei? 'Nuff said!

$10,000 a month for my 150 ping house w/backyard.
  - wow

8. Getting away. Taipei is a little bubble of Not Taiwan completely different from everywhere else in Taiwan, a bubble whose walls often prove to be surprisingly strong. You work and work and work, and one day you wake up and realize it's been months since you've been out of the city, and Taiwan itself remains a land unknown to you. We don't have this problem in Taichung. It's really, really easy to leave Taichung.
  - ***

10. We're in the real Taiwan. Taichung is the real Taiwan, where people work in factories, drive second-hand scooters, and sit in front of 7-11 drinking beer and chatting. Where the elementary school populations are measured in hundreds. Where the split between Blue and Green is 50-50 and our election campaigns are thus true contests and not pointless rituals of KMT dominance. Where gangsters run their wives for elected positions and gravel digging is a major industry. Where the hands down most awesome KTV in Taiwan, the Golden Jaguar, holds sway. Where herds of pachinko parlors and love hotels dot the landscape, a veritable Serengeti of vice. We're Taiwan, while Taipei... "it's Chinatown."

  - mmm, expat life, but should hike more, live cheap, save money





http://www.movetotaiwan.com/should-you-live-in-taipei/:
Having lived in Tainan and driven a scooter all the time, it’s really nice to live in Taipei and not have to deal with a 20 minute commute through crazy traffic.

When I lived in Tainan, I could get everywhere in the city in about 15 minutes, so getting around was a breeze. At the same time, it was also much easier to get outside the city and go exploring in the countryside on my scooter. If you are the kind of person that likes to quickly and easily get outside the city on your own transportation (i.e. scooter), then Taipei may not be the place for you.
  - *****

if your goal is to come to Taiwan and save a lot of money, then either you need to be disciplined while living in Taipei, or you may want to consider somewhere else where there are either less places to go or less expensive options.
  - yep

You you probably won’t get a chance to practice Chinese with these kinds of friends (not because they won’t want to help you, but because it’s easy and natural to revert to English when they speak it so much better than you can speak Chinese). I personally find Taipei much harder to pick up Chinese than when I lived in Tainan because so many people here already speak English at such a high-level. If you think you can avoid these traps, or are dedicated to learning and won’t let it get in your way, then don’t worry about it. However, if you think this may have an impact on your learning, then you probably want to consider whether a different place may be better suited to studying Chinese.
  - yep





michael turton:
http://www.michaelturton.com/Taiwan/taliao.html
  - great observations
  - As with most Taiwanese students, they study hard and behave impeccably, but lack critical thinking skills, curiousity about the world around them and love of learning.  As the nation democratizes the educational system is undergoing reform, so perhaps there is hope.
  - you can always find more work (just open the newspaper)
  - Taiwanese see themselves as  ensconced in networks of patronage and factional alliances, not as autonomous individuals like we do…However, it is also a management tactic to get you to put in unpaid hours at functions like Christmas parties for the kids, or grade homework for nothing, etc.
  - A typical Taipei alley.  This one, off Fuhsing N. Rd. in Taipei, shows a number of the features that render Taiwanese cities so unlivable: high population densities, a lack of sidewalks and parking, different types of vehicles using the same space, government indifference to private use of public space (note how the sign juts into the road), the dearth of light and moving air, and constant decay and repair of streets.  By the same token, they highlight the convenience, due to the high population density, of having many different kinds of business services available in a single neighborhood. Most neighborhoods in Taipei, Kaohsiung and other cities are similarly crammed.  Residents fight back against the inhuman conditions by raising plants and caring for each other in neighborly ways.
  By custom, the space in front of a shop or house belongs to that shop.  That custom will be enforced by violence if necessary, by anyone concerned.  Once a friend parked his car in front of what we thought was a deserted building.  No sooner had we killed the engine than out of the building ran a little girl of nine or ten. To our amusement and despite our shouts, she immediately began kicking in the side of my friend's car.


  - There are several other ways to find rentals. 

The very best, #1 way is to drive around until you find a neighborhood which appeals in the area you like, then....

A bulletin board, found in almost every neighborhood, advertises places to live.	...look for the red and yellow signs advertise rentals and sales. Typically these are posted on telephone poles, walls, abandoned cars, etc. However, houses for sale may also be available for rent. It never hurts to call and ask.
  - YEP!
  - also school boards*
  - good way to get furniture!*

First, drive around until you find a neighborhood you like. Then find empty houses in the neighborhood and ask next-door neighbors (bring a local for this one). We've located good houses this way.

Remember, every neighborhood has empty houses. Many people have given up trying to find renters -- something like a third to a half of all houses in Taichung are empty -- so your appearance is a great opportunity for them.***

A typical alley in central Taiwan. Houses have no yards, and crowd each other. The problem of crowded, unlivable urban areas even in rural settings like this one derives from archaic and inefficient land-use laws, not population density, as the locals often assume.

cities:
Despite the identical dreary hideousness of the local infrastructure, Taiwan's cities  have distinct personalities.

In general, northern Taiwan is more expensive and crowded than southern Taiwan. A two-bedroom fourth-floor flat in Taipei rents for $10 - 12,000 a month, a five-bedroom house outside of Kaohsiung (with a garden in front and a play area in back) goes for $10,000. However, you can probably find a house in your range anywhere, if you ask around.

Opportunities for other kinds of work are greater in the north (but teaching pay is higher in the south), and the cities of Taipei and Hsinchu are more cosmopolitan. The south, especially outside of Kaohsiung, is one of the most dirty, polluted, ill-run places on the planet. In the south and outside the cities, the use of both Mandarin and English disappears rapidly. Further, while theft and vandalism are serious problems in Taipei, they are simply obnoxious down south. 

The East Coast remains clean and beautiful.  If you are into the outdoors, you might consider relocating to Taitung, Hualien or I-lan. Good luck finding a job, though.

Another factor to consider in choice of cities is that the foreign population in Taipei is more diverse and interesting. Taichung is the center of missionary activity. Many long-term expats have relocated to Taichung due to its excellent weather. Tainan has a great historic atmosphere. Kaohsiung has little for foreigners besides English teaching.

Weatherwise, the south is better.  Taipei is beautiful in the spring and fall, but it can rain every day from January to April in some years, which is why I will not live there. Winter temps can reach the low 40s or even the high 30s in Taipei. Standing in an unheated home in February watching your breath fog up the computer screen is an experience that will make you wish you had moved to Kaohsiung.  In Kaohsiung it may dip into the 50s now and then, but you'll be fine with a long sleeve shirt in most winters.*
  - Gaoxiong way less rain, only during typhoon
  - Gaoxiong better highs during winter, and shorter winter
  - east coast actually has less total rainfall by 1/5, and same temperatures

Small towns, despite their bucolic appeal, are not only dull but rife with crime. Many are run by local officials working with organized crime gangs. Here's a page of pictures and commentary a one representative small town in southern Taiwan.

Taipei is cleaner, safer, more convenient and better-run than Taiwan's other cities (the government's tender care of Taipei is bitterly lampooned in the southern parody of KMT sloganeering: "stress the North, ignore the South").
  - yep

in Taipei, don't live in the city, or in the suburbs southwest of the city like Panchiao and San Chung, where there are high concentrations of industry. The pollution, traffic, and noise in those areas are debilitating.
  - yep

Live in the suburbs southeast or north of the city. Yung Ho, Mucha, or Neihu are good places to live. Tienmu, the foreign ghetto, is expensive and everyone speaks English. Additionally, it can be a pain to get into Taipei, since there is only one route into the downtown. 
  - hmmm, a suburban guy

Since there are plenty of foreign restaurants and other opportunities to spend money you don't have on things you don't need, it is more difficult to save money.
  - really is a matter of controlling self

taizhong:
Known as "the California of Taiwan" for its superb weather, Taichung can be a great place to live. Months can pass without rain, just one gorgeous sunny day after another. 

Taichung is a cultural desert compared to the north or even Kaohsiung, but because of its wide streets, and cheap housing, it can be a nice place to live. Except for the cramped old city center around the train station, there's always a place to park your car. Rents are cheap, and there are numerous empty houses.
  - less than Gaoxiong! Ouch.

Haggling over camera parts in a market. Although the markets give the illusion of individualism and free enterprise, the reality is that in at least some cases the stands are owned by shops, who may scatter three or four tables around the market as if each were independent.
  - **

Food is the great recreation of the Taiwanese, and they will frequently travel miles out of their way just to eat a famous local treat. The vast array of local foods is one of the most enjoyable aspects of Taiwan. See my page on Food for more highly enjoyable details.
  - :)

Taiwan's many waterways offer excellent fishing possibilities...
  - :)

And after you are done hiking, you can stuff your face with junk food. 
  - hahahah :)

Much of the new tourist development has been concentrated on the still unspoiled east coast. Taiwan's east coast is a fabulous playground of parks, lakes, hiking trails, sea cliffs, and rock formations.

Taiwan is close to everywhere. / Taiwan is also an excellent base for exploring Asia, just a few hours from any destination.
  - yes!

In an open area at the former provincial capital, Chunghsinghsintsun. The new capital was built to house the provincial government and its employees after the current government fled to Taiwan in 1949. Taipei is merely the temporary national capital. In reality, the provincial government, now frozen and no longer functional, was a way to provide jobs for the ruling party faithful. The real Taiwan miracle is that the economy grew so well under such parasitic, inefficient and hopeless misgovernment.

Taiwan can be great family fun!
  - :)

We own an electric scooter. Although good for short trips, its limited range makes it useless as a vehicle for English teachers riding from one part of the city to another on jobs. Sad though it may seem, stick to gasoline power for the foreseeable future.

A parking lot tucked into a back alley. Parking fees are usually $40-60 per hour in the cities. The silver van is ours.
  - has a van! :)

transport:
The downside of motorcycles and scooters is that they  are unsafe.  Accidents are inevitable and merely a question of time.  Everyone I know has had accidents on their scooters, including this writer. 
Fortunately due to the low speeds caused by high traffic densities, most are minor.  Because of the mad traffic of Taipei you are better off using the wonderful public transportation system.

Taiwan is a world leader in bike manufacturing and high-quality bikes are cheap and plentiful across the island, as are places to get them repaired. Many locals and foreigners take extended bike trips around the island.


money:
Recyclables collected for a few dollars.
  - yes!

By the second year you fall into fixed habits, the luster has worn off the vacation spots, you've finally made the connections you need to ensure steady work and you're more focused on making money.

It is important to grasp that you save money in Taiwan not by making more money, but by lowering your standard of living (and for many people, dodging taxation). If you go out every night and have a beer, or purchase new toys for your computer, or take expensive vacations, the same thing happens as in the US: you don't save money. The laws of economics do not change when your address changes. A teacher working 35 hours a week at $600 an hour pulls down just over US$2,400 a month at the current exchange rate before taxes. 

Key point: for the first six months you are here, you pay 20% tax. That means that your 60K a month salary turns into 48K when you take it home, before other deductions.


Market gardening in central Taiwan. Intensive agriculture makes for expensive fruit.
  - *

Even more convenient, 7-11and the other convenience stores now take phone bills, water bills, parking fees and several other payments. Try them first.
  - *

Long the island's capital and now a center of Taiwanese nationalism, Tainan can be a great place to live. 

The local English schools and restaurants will have plenty of advertisements from people moving on and selling stuff cheap. Missionary organizations are also good places to locate stuff, since missionaries are constantly rotating out to new assignments.
  - * nice!

DIY types will be cheered to know that B&Q and numerous local DIY places are found everywhere. 
Each neighborhood also has one or more handymen who will install things like lights and water heaters quickly and cheaply.
  - DIY theory!

notes for foreigner:
I will say this: your best bet is always to act like a foreigner.  You cannot "be Taiwanese" nor will fluency in language make you more comfortable or help you navigate better.  In difficult situations stick to English.  Smile a lot.  Say nothing.

Remember, in every social situation, it is always acceptable to grovel and flatter. A constant stream of compliments should issue from your lips. They cost nothing, and will grease your way through society.

If you are seriously interested, check out Hartzell's Harmony in Conflict and Bo Yang's The Ugly Chinamen. Both paint accurate pictures of the Chinese, though Bo Yang often exaggerates for satiric effect.  Hartzell is well-known to all long-term foreigners in Taiwan (he has been a dogged battler on behalf of foreigners), knows Taiwan better than anyone and affects an entertaining innocence.  Because Harmony in Conflict was written during the martial law period, it is deliberately light on the deeper meaning of Chinese cultural forms.  When you finally understand "harmony" and "face" as cultural postures for reinforcing authoritarian domination of society, you will have arrived.  Most anthropological works are good for understanding the deeper roots of Taiwanese social behavior, but worthless as guides to behavior. 
  - try books!*

Keep in mind some simple rules. First, just because they speak English well doesn't mean that they are your friend, or intelligent, or sympathetic, or they understand you, or they want romance, or they are nice people. It just means that they have mastered English, and nothing more. Second, people who don't speak any English are just as smart as people who do. Don't worry; even though they can't speak English, they still see right through you. Most importantly, the people in Taiwan are human beings, just like you, with their own feelings, needs, and agendas. They were not put here on earth to ensure that you have an exotic cultural experience in Taiwan. So don't treat them like they are.
  - mmm

Finally, don't be fooled by politeness.  Politeness is to Chinese culture what a pearl is to an oyster: a beautiful secretion around a major irrititant.  It is the opposite of being accepted.  Its purpose is to keep you at arms length and under control.  You know you are accepted when they start treating you like crap just like everyone else.
  - aha!

2) "It's like it was a dream!" America is a fantasyland almost completely insulated from the outside world.  Unless you make of point of trying to keep in touch with it, the world will never pop up in your life when you are in the United States.  When you return to the US, Taiwan will vanish from your memory. It will seem as if it were another life, and another person had lived it. That's why I recommend you take copious photographs, especially video, so you can revisit your other self.  If only you could record the smell.... 
  - :)

3) "I made a mistake.  I shouldn't have come home."
If you really loved Taiwan, as I did, this feeling will never go away.  Deal with it. 
  - mmmm

In a lot of ways the Vino is like the many other retro scooters in its class. It’s got a nice storage space under the seat for a full face helmet, okay brakes, good quality, nice milage (great milage for the updated 4-stroke version) and shiny chrome bits. Other good scooters that share these traits are Vespa’s ET50 and LX50, Kymco’s Like and Sento models and Honda’s Metropolitan / Jazz. Have a look at all these scooters and decide based on looks, price and whether you want a 2-stroke or 4-stroke engine. There’s also a few other Taiwan built scooters like Genuine’s Buddy, PGO’s Metro, SYM’s Mio 50 and TNG’s Venice that offer a lot of value and quite respectable reliability as well.

Yamaha responded for 2002 with their all new 50cc Vino (model code YJ50). This first generation of Vino used a peppy 2-stroke motor and was sold from 2002 - 2005. For 2006 Yamaha freshened up the Vino with a fuel sipping 4-stroke engine and a bunch of smaller style tweaks. This second generation used the model code XC50 and remains on sale as of 2015

The Honda Met is very reliable and great gas mileage. You could get a brand new SYM DD 50 or maybe a SYM Fiddle for that price depending on whether or not your dealer does all that prep and delivery extra fees or not.

housing:
Remember, you don’t have to rent an apartment. You can build your own. Just find a nice area and build a shack. Or, you can find an area and ask around for special houses — rooftop, traditional single floor houses, etc.

  - 6000, temp room, check it out?
  - why not just live in a hostel for the moment?
    - cost a lot for one day

Do your best to find one with a clean sounding engine, which isn't more than 9-10 years old. Check that an abundance of smoke doesn't come out the back. Check the brakes, the lights, drive it around.

While the Japanese motorcycles can seem quite cool, they are a pain to maintain and have been said to break down quite frequently.

1. transfer insurance at current owner’s insurance agent (or get a new one)
  - Taiwan has a basic minimum insurance
2. transfer title at DMV

docs:
Both parties' ids, a valid arc & passport if you are from overseas
The seller's stamp, or a signature in person if you are from overseas
The current insurance card
The current owner's registration 行照 - DMV keeps this
The scooter's title 牌照登記書
The NT$150

what’s left:
One of the two Transfer Applications 過戶登記書 you filled out in duplicate.
A New Registration 行照
The title 牌照登記書 - the original if your seller had it, now amended with your name on it, or a new title with only your name on it if the original owner did not have the title with them.

x/1. try a bunch of real estate agents
  - one of each company
  - just got websites and 591
    - but lost the website

main:
FUCK using computer for housing. GET OUT! :)

591 - most dwellings, use map, <5000 / 5000-10000 / 10000-15000, sort by ping
housefun - same as 591 with less dwellings

real estate::
http://www.yungching.com.tw/
  - have to open post to see pictures
http://www.century21.com.tw/franchisees/index.aspx?storeid=h193&fn=rent_list
  - none or very expensive

other:
http://taipei.sublet.com/
craigslist
  - spammed by young real estate entrepreneurs
tealit
  - sometimes
https://www.facebook.com/groups/148016638725267/ - close group
https://www.facebook.com/groups/Taiwanapartmentsandroommates/ - sometimes, can post wanted
https://www.facebook.com/groups/RentalApartments/ - okay, mostly furnished shared apartments, quite good for that, found two that were quite good

信：
你好！ 我現在找出租套房。我看過網站（591，house fun，什麼的）沒有那麼好的房子。我覺得這辦法找房子比較棒。

我想要住在老公禹。最重要的特性是我需要屋頂。我覺得最高樓平常允許用屋頂（或很的陽台），所以我想要那種的。還需要窗戶（大的當然比較好）。 如果我真的喜歡，我可以租很久。我想自己擺設屋子。

地區：通化市場旁邊／東南（大安區，信義區），可能：松山區，萬華區，社子區。

關於我：
我是美國來的，有美國的公司的設計成式的工作。我來台灣住，創造藝術，設計技術。這是我理由想要空間多一點。


總算如果你知道,聽說這種的房子，請送我一封電郵(rahil627@gmail.com）或給我一個打電話（0979-626-454）。
