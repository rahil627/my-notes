easy to see from Google Maps which areas are like Backpacker’s Planett:
3km from mountain / beginning of stream
1km from city proper

0. Taipei [City] (not New Taipei City, not Yangmingshan).
1. Luodong/Yilan as best east Taiwan cities
  - can be rainy / cold during winter months ((8)/9/10/11/(12)). Just need a fire-place. And rainy all year.
2. east side Taiwan
  - have to find the right town, though no town is cultural like western Taiwan.

x. (the west side is unlivable)

x/Chiayi is perhaps the best located west Taiwan city
  - can take train to Tainan for art events
  - only city on the west close to the mountain range, with ali shan and ganzhiling springs!
  - some of the worst pollution, especially in the winter, perhaps even worst than the city areas of Tainan and Gaoxiong! Second only to Yunlin and Nantou counties.  Must live in the mountain.
  - cultural, being one of the oldest towns


Anymore is too far. Life within 3km.

It turns out Taipei doesn’t have any nearby waterfall / stream sources! Furthermore, the beaches are rocky and probably suck in general (over-populated, trashed, etc.).

  - “Both cities sound like decent options if you're fine not having much of a social life. Chiayi is the gateway to Alishan and Hualien is the gateway to Taroko, two of the finest parts of Taiwan. If you're self-motivated enough to get on a bike at least every weekend you could have fun in both. Both will be convenient. Both will require more spoken Chinese to navigate. Both will lack a variety of good western dining options. Both will probably have crappy public transportation, necessitating the use of a scooter or bicycle to get around.
A few differences to consider: Chiayi is far better connected to many urban centers on the west coast. It's close enough to Tainan that you can hop on the train and go check out one of the famous night markets there if the mood struck you. Kaohsiung isn't much further. Of course, being on the west coast means you're going to deal with lots of nasty wintertime pollution... but it's also drier than Hualien. Finally, one more advantage to Chiayi: it has way more history than Hualien.
Hualien, on the other hand, is a rather small, remote city, and there aren't too many other built-up places you can escape to for a day once you're there (but you can get to Taipei in a jiffy if need be). Chiayi has mountains but Hualien has mountains and beautiful coastline so that's something to consider, but with all that extra natural beauty you're also going to deal with a bigger earthquake and typhoon threat.
Honestly I'd consider living in both cities if given the opportunity but I haven't spent enough time in either to know as much as I'd like. If you're more into nature and aboriginal culture then I think Hualien has a slight advantage. If you like night markets and history and access to big urban centers then Chiayi has a definite advantage.”

  - lol
  - “Chiayi has the grime. Inland and nestled at the foot of the mountains, the pollution doesn't have anywhere to go, so it just hangs there. The air pollution gets so thick that it actually hides the mountains from view. I was in Chiayi four months before I knew there were mountains (ie: before it rained).”



http://tw.forumosa.com/t/yilan-or-pingdong/11156/3
  - “Tough choice but remember that Pintung is not as "countryside" as you'd think...........

You'd have to live almost in Kenting to escape the Kaoshiung air......Very often the pollution index readings in Pintung county are unhealthy as all that foul industrial air gets trapped against the mountains. Pintung is also very monochrome in it's scenery, betel nut trees and farms, flat as a pancake. Can't fault the winter weather though........nice.

Ilan is poised to take off soon. The completion of the number 5 highway next year will make living in Ilan an easier commute than many of the Taipei suburbs. Winters are very wet, with many places exceeding 200cm of precipitation per year. But Ilan is convenient for it's mountain/ocean access, and of course it's relative closeness to the Taipei city center. Stay out of Suao though..............

If I had to choose between the two, I'd pick Ilan. But my own first choice would be somewhere in the rift valley south of Yuli…..”
  - “I lived in Yilan county (Toucheng) for six months and I visited Pingdong for a couple of days. I'd say possibly go with Pingdong.

While Yilan county can be jaw-droppingly beautiful at times, the rain got to me. God, it was raining five days a week towards the end of my stay there. It seriously had a negative impact on my mood. That, and the lack of central heating in the winter. Living in Toucheng has even less to recommend than Yilan city or Luodong, especially considering I can't surf. But when it was sunny, it was fantastic. I'd also put a recommendation to go with Luodong. There's some expensive housing near the Luodong Sports Park, but that park is absolutely beautiful, you're next to some nice bars, there are a few nice foreigners who live in the area, and the night market is pretty decent.

My impression of Pingdong is limited, but I really liked the whole south Taiwan vibe. Yeah, you might have to get a bit outside Pingdong city to get some good air. But it's probably the one place I want to go to (or Tainan) after I finish my contract here.”

  - cool!
  - sounds like a really fun trip: old streets for culture, hot springs / waterfalls for nature. Touristy, but fun, pleasant.


I did an east coast ride back in the summer. My route was:

http://www.forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=134&t=104122&start=40
Day 1: Hualian city to Yuli along the 193 (about 100km). Like Feiren said, I found Hualian city itself to be a bit of a pain in the ass to get out of and almost wish I had gotten off the train a stop later in Ji'An. Anyhow, the 193 was fantastic and the mountain scenery along that road was prettier than anything on the coast.

Day 2: Yuli to Zhiben (about 120km) Took the 193 until it ends and joins the 9, did the 9 for a bit, then I took the 23 across the mountains to the coast. Again, the 23 was absolutely fantastic, though it seems it would be a bit sketchy in terms of landslides/construction if there's been a bit of a rain. The coastal scenery along the 11 was only okay, mostly because there's more traffic here than on the 193 or 23. Don't bother to stop in Dulan, since there seems to be nothing there.

Day 3: Zhiben to Fangliao (about 110km). I continued on the 11 south to where it hits the 9, kept going on the 9 south and around the peninsula. I was surprised how dangerous I felt the 9 was around Taimali. Nearly as bad as the Dong'ao/Nan'ao section of the 9. Going around the 9 as it curves towards Gaoxiong county, there's an intersection where you can go to either Kending or north to Fangliao, where you can take the regular train to Gaoxiong city where you could then high speed train it back to Taipei.

to living on the east side of Taiwan:
http://followxiaofei.com/page/ashers-taiwan-hot-springs-and-waterfalls-map
  - east of Pingdong county has perhaps the highest amount of waterfalls!
  - use waterfalls as shower! :D
  - near the mountain is absolutely necessary!

pollution in Taiwan (and the rest of the world)
clean from Taipei (and new Taipei) to Hengchun!
  - yep, **fuck West Side Taiwan. It’s bland, hazy, hot, without wind.**
    - Taipei is still a better choice, even with the rainy, sunshine-less weather? Well, not so sure. Really have to replace nature’s natural way of waking one up with the sun and wind with social, cultural means of waking up — waking up because one wants to be with people.

weather in Taiwan

pollution:
http://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/en/PollutantMonitoringDataMonthlyReport.aspx
  - monthly reports!
  - 3/2017:
  - **28 Taidong**, 33 Hualian, 38 Yilan, 37 Dongshan
  - 31 Hengchun, 21 Yangming(shan?!?!)
  - 44 Guting
  - 68 Tainan
  - 71 Pingdong

http://taqm.epa.gov.tw/pm25/en/default.aspx
  - Hengchun and Tainan City are outstanding
  - Tainan City, Taidong, and Hualien are about the same
  - the west side hugging the mountains are the worst. So the waterfalls now become a dream. :(

  - “The pollution and shenanighans on the roads are my two biggest complaints about Taiwan. It might be enough of a reason to move in 3-5 years but I have no idea what my future plans are. it definitely will not be anywhere in China though.”

seasons
west side
east side
Mid-Nov often seems to mark a dramatic change in the weather. It's when the coldfronts start moving down from the north west.

0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hengchun#Climate
  - 2,200 sunshine hours
  - 2000mm rain, 129 avg rainy days
  - little to no pollution
  - the only part of west side Taiwan that doesn’t have pollution!
  - no train station
  - winter retreat? Along with the cities (Tainan and Taipei)?

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taitung_City#Climate
  - 1700 sunshine hours
  - 1800mm rain, 125 rainy days
  - November to April with only 100 sunshine hours per month, whereas Tainan keeps it steady with 175
  - **June to August with 170+ sunshine hours**, like the rest of the east side (and Taipei)
  - May and October still have 150 (in between months)
  - so, 3-5 months sunny, 7-9 months sunshine-less

2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei#Climate
  - 1400 sunshine hours
  - 2405mm rain, 165 average rainy days

2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tainan#Climate
  - more sun and less rain than “sunny” Taizhong, making it the best city by weather
  - 2180 sunshine hours
  - 1700mm, 87 rainy days
  - the only problem is that pollution exists, and it gets stuck in the air during winters, just like Pingdong
  - later rainy season starting in October, maybe cutting into September, whereas Taidong has a bunch



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hualien_City#Climate
  - 2150mm rain


humidity:
all are at 75-77%, maybe elevation makes a difference

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chianan_Plain
  - The Chianan Plain or Jianan Plain (Chinese: 嘉南平原; pinyin: Jiānán Píngyuán) is an alluvial plain located at the central-southern region of western Taiwan. It is the largest plain of the island,[1] and lies in Tainan City and Chiayi County/Chiayi City…It also includes some portions of Yunlin County, Changhua County, and Kaohsiung City.
  - Average rainfall in this area is about 1600 mm, lowest in the whole island of Taiwan, and the rainy season is in summer, thus the plain lacks rain in winter.

  - contains a good map 40 year precipitation map
  - Taidong manages to have the least on the east side
  - Gaoxiong < Tainan < Pingdong < Hengchun = Taidong (from Taimali to below Dulan) < Hualian < Taipei < Yilan < Jilong (NE) = Suao / Nanao
  - The west coast being the driest, having more rain nearer the mountains

http://forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=110418
  - really good post about living and working in Taidong
  - “I’d definitely choose Taidong out of your two options. Besides having more appeal to me as a place to live, it's also an easy enough drive up the East Coast to Hualian and the multitude of attractions in between, a comfortable drive down to the Hengchun Peninsula, a not-too-bad drive across to Kaohsiung if you need to visit a big city, an easy ferry ride to Green Island, and a quick flight away from Taipei.”
    - Taidong vs Hengchun
  - “I’d rather have a child attend a school in Taidong where children actually live as children and mix with children who live in the real world away from the droll, sheltered mundane lives that the kids in other cities must endure throughout their childhood.
The standard of education may not be on a par with Taipei, but who cares? The whole system in Taiwan sucks anyway and I'd swap life skills, play and proper social education with reams of boring, pointless books that don't educate anyway.”
    - “Except they don't get life skills or a proper social education. They also only sort of get to play. They get to play in as much as the school day is shorter than that of the average kid in the north, and they're less likely to attend buxiban. However, Taidong is not some Finnish-like developmental wonderland. Firstly, what they do at school is generally more of the same. Secondly, many of the kids at my school live in the school dorms because their familes are quite poor. I have students who come from families where there is no refrigerator in the house or where they live in a one bedroom house and all of the kids have to sleep on couches or the floor of the living room. Some of my colleagues send the left over lunches home with some students so that their families will have adequate food. Many of my students' parents are alcoholics, have mental health issues, etc. and are completely irresponsible. Many kids here have been abandoned by parents who have either left them with their grandparents or other relatives, and only return a few times a year, or who have gone for good. A good 50% or more of my students have never been out of Taidong County, and may not have even been out of our immediate area. It's not like their parents provide them with books or generally do stuff with them. Most of these kids are dragged up through childhood, if that. Many are left entirely to their own devices, which may mean they spend their entire free time in front of a television or else getting up to mischief. I suspect few would have really had the social framework around them to even get out into nature and explore it in a productive way.

I am against the general state of education in the more advanced parts of Taiwan, but down here, the absence of a draconian workload in education is not replaced by vast opportunities in other ways. It is replaced by a great poverty of opportunities and spirit. Let's not romanticise poverty. Unfortunately, as screwed up as the general education system here is, for many in this part of Taiwan at least, it may be their only opportunity to break a tragic cycle.”
    - “The countryside is no wonderland panacea to the ills of the city. The kids I know in Miaoli also spend inordinate amounts of time watching TV and playing online games in their spare time. At the same time, their educational opportunities are more limited , the infrastructure can be poor (although Taiwan is pretty good about this usually..having post office/police station/hospital nearby most of the time), the main impediment is the VERY low incomes.”
    - “Go out to places near Yangming Shan and JinShan and you can see almost exactly the same conditions you have described above.”
    - “And at least children in rural areas do actually grow up naturally to become adults instead of succumbing to the pressures of an intensive academic life, developing mental issues themselves or eventually flinging themselves off a building.”
  - …”Many of my colleagues (and the local police) turn a blind eye to the copious numbers of students here (and even at elementary school) who ride scooters, and do so without helmets.”…”I'm not at all enamoured with the schools in the north, but I'm also not enamoured with the schools here either. The difference to some extent though is that if you lived in the north and did nothing extra (and resisted the school putting pressure on you), your kid would still get a decent enough education (because he would have better, more responsible teachers, and he also wouldn't have to contend with a whole bunch of clowns for classmates constantly screwing around) and could have a childhood.”
  - “I certainly won't be sending my kids to the schools here when I eventually have them. My wife and I will be home schooling our own kids. I'm not sure if I would send them to schools in the north either (probably not), but there might be some more options.”

  - also a good post about living with a family in Taiwan

https://forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=89875&start=120
  - I’ve been here for almost 25 years and have been all over the country many, many times. I live just outside Taipei City for the express reason that its so much LESS run down, noisy, polluted and dusty than any other of the cities here, with the possible exceptions of Taidong or Hualian -- and good luck finding work down there.
  - I would spent most of the year in Taipei but 'snowbird' it down south during the winter--probably Taidong or Tainan. I could conceivably be a year-rounder in Taidong even. Not Tainan, though--muggy as hell in the summer. Taichung has nice winters, though windy.
  - “It's pretty much stagnated since 2000 in many ways. Speed of change, at a fundamental level in their views towards society, environment, politics, work, education is very very slow since then. Hate to say it but if you take nationalism and fear of government out the equation the Chinese seem to be much more amenable to change and recognise a lot of the issues in their society and a lot more clued in about international affairs. What has REALLY changed in Taiwan in the last 10 years. Scooters, burning money on sidewalks, bad pavements, dangerous driving, legal system, river and air pollution, working conditions, salaries, mobility in society, education system, views towards other races...a lot of things have hardly budged at all. THings are changing , just much slower than other places and compard to their level of economic development.
    The big advances like health system, open parliamentary elections, MRT and High speed rail..they were all planned and really executed in the 1990s. The stuff since then like the plastic bag tax and removal of 50cc scooters and implementation of maternity leave for mothers, mostly been failures or window dressing at best. Almost no major change in any area whatsoever, it seems gridlocked, both in peoples heads and in the government. Look at the way the government still tries to railroad large polltuing projects through and the local police still assist in that and most of the population just accept it along with the vote buying, no real care towards the wild animals here still either (e.g. white dolphins). Hopefully civic society will win through even with the minority of people caring.”

  - “As for the east, Yilan, Luodong, Jiaoshi are less than an hour to Taipei via the tunnel.”

  - “Actually, I live here in Pingdong county, and I'm dreading going back to Taichung next year to finish my MA.

The weather is awesome and the people are friendly. As long as you don't mind living in the countryside, (I'm about 40 minutes by motorcycle away from KKH), the south and east are the best.”

  - “The main things to remember about Taipei air pollution is it is 98% vehicle exhaust according to the EPA. Get away from traffic and you are fine unless there is an inversion such as before a heavy rainfall. Then the air can be still and foul for the whole day. Ozone is a problem on hot days during the late morning and afternoon but then it is too hot to be outside anyways. 

On average statistics show the air quality downtown is comparable to London or New York. Much better in the suburbs. I hike in the hills in the south and there are lots of days I can see clear across town to the ocean.”
  - mountains of Taipei as best place to live?

  - “appenstance. My wife was from Muzha. We met when we were both in Taoyuan and on visits back to her family I noticed it was a hell of a lot greener. My wife of course was happy to move closer to her family. Over the years this neighborhood has gotten better and better, so there is no reason to leave. 

I like the north part of the city too. We do have quicker access to the mountains here though unless you live right on Yangming Shan. Also the trails are natural and a lot less busy. But Tianmu, Guandu, Bali and so on are all good places to live. I love that I can go for long walks and bike rides here in Muzha at night completely off road and hear owls and crickets and breathe fresh air. And we have all the tea houses and restaurants in the hills. Nothing like sitting on a patio at 6pm overlooking a lush valley that drops into the city teeming with traffic and noise and knowing how lucky you are. 

But I must get going. I've got to drive to Tatajia. I am finally going to climb Yushan tomorrow.”

  - “Hualian is a beautiful county. Hualian city, pretty much ike every other city or town in Taiwan, is a craphole”

  - “In the future, I will probably live somewhere in Yilan, Taidong or Pingdong Counties” by GuyinTaiwan in 2008

  - “Living close
to Yilan is good in theory
but then the tunnel jams
every weekend. simply
too many people in North Taiwan.”

  - “I guess that I'm not the most indicated person for saying what the best pace to live in is, but I would dare to say that if you want to have a "standard" life, may be the place would be somewhere in the east part of Taipei, near the hills. Perhaps in one of those neighborhoods near National Palace Museum, perhaps in the new colonies in Xindian, but somewhere near the hills and far from the horrible concrete and smoke jungle.

  - Taichung looks overall a better city when it comes to buildings and so (better ratio of new buildings to third world shit wholes), but weather looks drier and you can feel, perhaps, more pollution. Besides, Taipei might have greater cultural offer, although it's still poor. Also, as somebody pointed out before, Taichung is not as close to the mountains and recreation areas as Taipei. Plus Taipei has a nicer coast than what you can see in the West.

If you just want to have a small business that you can run anywhere and love live in nature, but still need some civilization close enough (as much as possible in this island), then Hualian or Yilan are good options. For example, I wouldn't mind at all to run a guest house in Hualian. 

If you a total hermit, then you have so many place to choose from: central Taiwan is full of mountains, some of them of difficult access, and you still have more accessible places like Miaoli and others.

Places to avoid: 

1. Keelung (Jilong): yeah, it is in the fuckin' coast, but it's also surrounded by something that could be defined as half industry half wasteyard. Ugly as fuck, no matter how many lightning letter they put anywhere. Plus, what's the fun in there?
2. Kaoshioung: I can't visit the place and breath at the same time. Yeah, it's difficult not to breath for 1 or 2 days, and some people even die out of lack of oxygen, but that still feels better than to smell those pipes, fumes, and the city in general. Seriously, that city smells of petrochemical shit.
3. small "cities" that look like slums: may be I'm totally wrong, but I think that you can easily become a soulless fuckup after living in one of those sad places for just a few months.”


http://forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=85882
  - “That's pretty clear, and such places certainly exist. Very few jobs there, though. You could always go through a recruiter and stipulate no cities. However, you'll find that those guys will invariably offer you jobs in absolute shitholes that have real problems hiring among teachers who already live in Taiwan and know perfectly well how awful such places can be -- I don't know what your country is like, but here, its the cities that get the money and the urban renewal, while the smaller towns in many rural areas tend to be filthy, with non-existent infrastructure and horrendous pollution. THIS is the reason so many people prefer the cities -- has very little to do with expat bars, MacDonalds and western food.”
  - “Yup. The people in those idyllic areas tend to be far too busy making a living to indulge themselves in a hobby as expensive as studying English as a second language.

      There is work to be had teaching aboriginal kids in very remote villages, but those jobs are usually either done by volunteers or else the teachers are recruited out of school by the government and get basically food, board and a little spending money for a stint of two or three months.”

  - “Yilan?”
  - “Yilan is only one step up from Taidong though. It suffers all the same problems due to size, lack of local wealth, and job opportunities.”
