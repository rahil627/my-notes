      -  "sent money from US to Taiwan, so my experience may not be universal. What I did was, I got a hold of the phone number of the bank in Taiwan that my relative has an account. I called the bank and asked for options. I found out that the cheapest way for me is to send my relative in Taiwan a US personal check. My relative deposit this check in his local branch in Taiwan. The bank charges him 1100 NTD. Wire transfer would cost me more in total fees. The downside of depositing a personal check in the bank in Taiwan, is that the bank holds the money for 3 weeks."

remember:
  - can take scooter on train
  - can take bicycle on train
    - **these two make living along the train way better, opening up any town or city along the train from 太麻里 to 花蓮**
 - though, can hitch-hike very easily along the east coast
 - 台東 is closer to the harbor to 蘭嶼, though, if I am going, it doesn't matter as long as I'm somewhere on the east
 - 台東 very close to 都蘭，成功，池上, forming a nice circle route
   - **these two make the area around 台東, between 太麻里 and 池上 ideal**
 - aboriginals are more beautiful, but have American culture as opposed to Taiwanese culture, and I really admire Taiwan's culture, making it another good reason to live in one of the train towns

  - banking on page 24
  - Bank of Taiwan (400nt, bad rep), Citi Bank (minimum 10kntd), International Commercial Bank of China (aka Mega ICBC, maybe best for big banks), all offer international money transfers. The Postal Savings System of Taiwan? (I don't think so). Union Bank (400nt, but outgoing requires paperwork, gives debit and credit cards)

    - **perhaps can write myself a check and use remote check scan to deposit into Charles Schwab?**

**Conclusion: 玉山 for PayPal transfers (until I try the remote deposit scan or learn Bitcoin) and post office for convenience.**
