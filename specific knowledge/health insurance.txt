about “Obamacare” in an e-mail to Dad:
Not sure if you applied for Mom or not, but the "Obamacare" thing is due 2/15, then insurance will start from 3/1.

Also, you got a few pamphlets about Medicare (or Medicaid?) for being 65+, but I didn't see a date for it.

I tried this myself with $0 income and no house, and receive nothing. I believe household income has to be between $12000 and $35000. Anyway, it's $150 for a "catastrophic" plan (no charge after deductible) or $300 for the best plan. They probably don't even work out of the country -- would really need to read the terms.

It works for Shila Kaki. I don't think it will help for Mom because it goes by household income, not individual income.
