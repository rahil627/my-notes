    - Although only about one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is suitable for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by the small size of farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses.[112] Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems.[112] Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized.[113]

  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Taiwan
    - In 2013, there are four main agricultural produce sectors in Taiwan, which are plant crops (47.88%), livestock (31.16%), fishery (20.87%) and forest (0.09%).
    - In 2013, agriculture sector contributes around 1.69% of its gross domestic product (GDP) with a total value of NT$475.90 billion.[7] Combined with agriculture-related tourism sector, it contributes to 11% of Taiwan's GDP.
    - In 2010, the food self-sufficiency of Taiwan was 32%.

Peace corps has a few very specific programs for EMTs which mostly involve education. HIV/Aids/STDs etc.. Or disaster coordination ie who has a ladder and who has rope in the village. Your skills will definetly be used by people in your village if you get a remote assignement. People will look to you for guidence during medical emergencies. An EMT is always valuable to people in less fortunate areas..

most international jobs I have found prefer Paramedics, but I have seen U.S. DOD contract jobs that will hire NREMT-I however, if your a state EMT-I with out your NREMT your going to have a harder time. 
Also Ireland and many other countries recognize the NREMT and will grant you reciprocity if your transcripts and training match theres and you hold NREMT.

International jobs are no overnight process, they take a lot of time and paper work on your end. Also many countries EMS training and standards are much higher than the U.S. for example the UK, and many EU countries require Paramedics to hold a Bachelors degree. 

Some middle eastern countries are recruiting I.E. Saudi Arabia 

for now I would check out http://www.medhunters.com/ You might be able to land an ED tech job somewhere or possibly an ambulance job as a lower level EMT in most country's. Other than that DOD contracting is your other road to look into, good luck and remember its going to take a while, do not give up

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-things-firefighters-and-paramedics-wont-tell-you-2014-08-22?page=7
  - Only about 30% of the nation’s firefighters are “career” firefighters who do the job full-time, and they’re mostly concentrated in urban areas. The rest are volunteer, part-time or per diem firefighters — those who only get called out during wildfires, for example. Many rural and suburban departments are run entirely on a volunteer basis or supplemented with career firefighters during the day or night.

  - Making things worse, however, as many as 70% of firefighters, both career and volunteer, are obese or overweight, exceeding the national average, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in July. The International Association of Firefighters, disputes the CDC’s findings, saying the agency just measured body-mass index, or BMI, and not whether firefighters were fit to do their job.
    - lolol

  - Who responds to your 911 call obviously depends on how serious the situation is. Nevertheless, nowadays the first objective of any EMT is simply to stabilize the patient and transport him or her to a higher level of care. Even paramedics, who can administer life-saving drugs, insert breathing tubes and can read cardiac monitors, can’t do a lot of interventions in the field that they used to without an OK from a doctor at a hospital first.

  .While sometimes the best treatment is “oxygen and diesel” as many paramedics like to say, Green, the retired San Francisco paramedic, thinks the U.S. needs smarter, more highly trained responders. “A paramedic in Canada has 2,000 hours of training…They are fully independent practitioners who have doctors just a phone call away if they need it.”

   .While paramedics in the U.S. also typically have doctors to consult with via radio, Green says, most jurisdictions discourage regular consultations unless the situation is unique and require paramedics to follow standing orders instead.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedics_in_Canada
  - Paramedic wages in Canada vary depending on province and experience. Paramedics in Ontario in such regions or cities as Ottawa, Toronto, Peel Region, or Durham, will have an annual salary starting from $70,000 to $90,000 as a Primary Care Paramedic, an Advanced Care Paramedic salary can on average range from $75,000 to $96,000, and Critical Care Paramedics range from $100,000 to $115,000. [27] Education background, experience, and level of practice all are contributing factors to which salary is established. [28]

http://www.tetongravity.com/forums/showthread.php/133626-EMT-WEMT-or-OEC-for-Ski-Patrol/page3
MTNmedic, agreed on the PHTLS

I took the WEMT course through SOLO this year and almost immediately got a job at a paramedic service that then hooked me up with a PHTLS course at the hospital. Just interviewed for ski patrol last week, and though I have to attend their OEC refresher later with month, I do not need the OEC or need to challenge it as far as I know. I'll pipe back in on that after the refresher though.

PHTLS, was fantastic and I learned WAAAAY more about pre hospital trauma in their two day course than I learned at the WEMT course. Especially since it was designed to teach physicians, paramedics and nursing staff. Far more than just basic stuff, some of it pretty advanced. The WEMT was great for the basics and wilderness application, as well as for helping to find work initially. A regular EMT course would have been great and provided a few months more practice and been cheaper, but if you don't mind spending the $ and wanna get the same info and training faster, just go WEMT.

I considered taking a WFR or OEC instead, but figured for the time and effort, I may as well get the whole shebang, so I went WEMT. It opens up far more options for you than an OEC or WFR course, and I found it to be quite extensive.

I wouldn't do it any other way. I went from unemployed with a sales background (which I hated), to overemployed and having to turn down hours and positions being offered in a new career field, all in less than 3 months. If you have the $ and time, go WEMT, no question....from what I understand OEC is pretty basic stuff and only applies to ski patrol...not too mention, it's behind the times on a few things. My 2 cents....

http://people.howstuffworks.com/firefighter-training.htm
Before you can become an active-duty firefighter, you need to spend about 600 hours in training, over the course of 12 to 14 weeks. That's somewhere between 40 to 48 hours per week, which makes firefighter training a full-time job. Training typically occurs at a fire academy, which is often run by the fire department, a division of the state government or a university.

https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/fire/employment-volunteer-opportunities/Pages/tidewater-reg-fire-acad.aspx
​Virginia Beach firefighter recruits will receive a salary and benefits while they attend the Tidewater Regional Fire Academy (TRFA) for 8 months. While in the academy, recruits attend classes Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm with occasional evenings and weekends, as deemed necessary by the TRFA Instructors.  Training includes four months of Fire Science classroom instruction and practicum and three months of Emergency Medical Technician-Advanced training including classroom instruction and practicum.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance#Crewing
8. Emergency Care Practitioner – This position, sometimes called 'Super Paramedic' in the media, is designed to bridge the link between ambulance care and the care of a general practitioner. ECPs are already qualified paramedics who have undergone further training,[89] and are trained to prescribe medicines for longer term care, such as antibiotics, as well as being trained in a range of additional diagnostic techniques.


http://www.paramedicpractitioner.com/
  - seems quite the autonomous role! Yay. But medicinal stuff usually requires university, as here, in the case of ECPs. I’m not so interested in that stuff, such as diagnostics, or prescribing medicine.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Care_Practitioner

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance#Military_use
As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic military training,[94] on the assumption that they may have to use a weapon. The laws of war do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.

conclusion:
1. EMT-B
2. EMT-I
3. Emergency skills through firefighter station

http://emtlife.com/threads/emt-curious-n00b-with-questions.44565/
  - very good, researched questions
  - WFR from NOLS, EMT-B accelerated at UCLA, work in country-side of Colorado

  - If you want to provide backcountry medical care, I wouldn't try work for a Denver FD, nor assume that you could easily get on with one. Those are hyper competitive urban systems for people who want to be career urban firefighters or fire medics.
    - hmmm, not fire department then?

  - If you want to provide backcountry medical care, I wouldn't try work for a Denver FD, nor assume that you could easily get on with one. Those are hyper competitive urban systems for people who want to be career urban firefighters or fire medics.

  - Where you get your EMT education only matters in terms of networking. But really as a new EMT, there is a limit to how far that will get you.

This is the plan I would follow if I was in your position:
-Take the EMT class asap, get a job immediately.
-Start nursing school for a BSN, continue to work part time as an EMT throughout. This gains you money and experience!
-Finish nursing school and get a job as a nurse. 
-Get 2 years of critical care experience as a nurse, make $$$, pay off loans.
-From here if you are sick of hospitals and want to pursue the FF/Medic pathway, you can take a 2-week RN-to-Paramedic program: https://ems.creighton.edu/training-certification/paramedic-certification-healthcare-providers-0
  - very good plan. critical care nurse makes $100,000! What the fuck. 5 times more than EMT.

You can also explore becoming a flight medic/nurse, nurse practitioner, CRNA, etc etc.

http://www.paramedictrainingspot.com/paramedic-vs-nurse-which-career-is-best/
  - $81,000 vs $45,000 pay
  - Nurses are licensed, paramedics are certified.
    - 11-18 month accelerated program

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_care_nursing
  - After 1750 hours of providing direct bedside care in a critical care area, a nurse can then sit for the CCRN exam.
  - All nurses in the US are registered as nurses without a specialty. The CCRN is an example of a post registration specialty certification in critical care.
  - ntensive care nurses are also required to be comfortable with a wide variety of technology and its uses in the critical care setting. This technology includes such equipment as hemodynamic and cardiac monitoring systems, mechanical ventilator therapy, intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP), ventricular assist devices (LVAD and RVAD), continuous renal replacement equipment (CRRT/CVVHDF), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits (ECMO) and many other advanced life support devices. The training for the use of this equipment is provided through a network of in-hospital inservices, manufacturer training, and many hours of education time with experienced operators. Annual continuing education is required by most states in the U.S. and by many employers to ensure that all skills are kept up to date. Many intensive care unit management teams will send their nurses to conferences to ensure that the staff is kept up to the current state of this rapidly changing technology.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services
  - The goal of most emergency medical services is to either provide treatment to those in need of urgent medical care, with the goal of satisfactorily treating the presenting conditions, or arranging for timely removal of the patient to the next point of definitive care.
  - In some jurisdictions, EMS units may handle technical rescue operations such as extrication, water rescue, and search and rescue.[20] Training and qualification levels for members and employees of emergency medical services vary widely throughout the world. In some systems, members may be present who are qualified only to drive ambulances, with no medical training.[10] In contrast, most systems have personnel who retain at least basic first aid certifications, such as Basic Life Support (BLS). Additionally many EMS systems are staffed with Advanced Life Support (ALS) personnel, including paramedics, nurses, or, less commonly, physicians.

8. There are other public service jobs that are somewhat related to your field of work-nurse, firefighter, police officer. What makes a man choose to become an EMT over other options?

Where I’m from, being a firefighter and an EMT or Paramedic are often one and the same. I would like to eventually move home and be a FF/EMT, but I need experience first. In systems where the two are separate, many people choose EMS over police or fire because, quite frankly, we make more money. In most systems, Paramedics make more than police officers or firefighters. Nurses make more money than Paramedics, but many of us stay in EMS because we enjoy being in the field, rather than the hospital. We are the first responders, the first on the scene. We treat and stabilize patients, then deliver them to the ER doctors and nurses.

9. What is the best part of your job?
The satisfaction of helping someone. To be honest, it’s not like TV, where we save a life every day. The calls where you make a difference between life and death are few and far between. But when you do, it is a wonderful feeling. It feels like your whole career is worth that one save.

11. What’s the work/family/life balance like?
Long, weird hours and low pay can have an impact on your family. I work two jobs, and therefore have an aggravated girlfriend waiting for me to get a day off. If you get into EMS after you’ve already been married, the divorce rate is very high. The key is having a spouse or significant other that understands your love of the job and your commitment to it. If you have a supportive family, you will be able to maintain a harmonious balance between work and home. Also, there is a camaraderie among EMT’s and Paramedics that is rarely found in any other profession. I have made some great friends here that I know I’ll keep for life.

13. Any other advice, tips, or anecdotes you’d like to share?
In all my rambling on in this article, I may have made this job seem very hard. It is. It can be very hard. But it is also the most rewarding job in the world. I cannot imagine doing anything else with my life. My advice would be to see if you can ride along with your local service before applying to paramedic school. Chances are you know an EMT or Paramedic, or know someone who does. Talk to them about who they are and what they do.
  - *****, hmmmm. Maybe a good starting point. Just ask to ride along a paramedic / firefighting squad. Volunteer. Then can see if I want to get a certification.

[from the comments section]
I'm an EMT in Nebraska on a private service; been doing it for 3 years now. We do 911 and non-emergent treatment/transport. You don't get into this job to get rich (don't let that discourage you). I personally make less than a manager at McDonalds. There is no other job more rewarding than being able to really make a difference though. We run calls, working almost 50-80 hours a week and sometimes more. I love it because I can't sit in an office or stand behind a register (once you've done this a while, it grows on you).

There is a downside though. You are exposed to the worst of mankind, diseases and disorders. You absorb the emotional toll of dealing with the worst of things no one should have to see; the 7 month old baby who drowned in a bowl of milk & cereal, the 92 year old man whose has been abused by his nursing home provider, the 17 year old girl who was texting behind the wheel and now she's in a ditch in a pool of her own blood. When you go home and you have no one to talk to about it unless they've worked this field. It takes a strong-minded person with a big heart to work EMS because if you don't have the stones to do it, you'll never survive.

http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-160/issue-11/features/ems-a-comparison-between-taiwan-and-the-united-states.html
In the past, EMS in Taiwan focused on transporting patients to hospitals; providers would only pick up the patients and drive them to a hospital emergency room. The government then passed a law in 1998 that mandated the equipment to be carried in ambulances, which put EMS in Taiwan on the right track.
  - holy fuck Taiwan.

STAFF
Career and volunteer personnel operate EMS stations in America, whereas only career firefighters provide EMS in Taiwan. Volunteers can join local fire departments and be trained as an EMT-1 or an EMT-2 but cannot respond to EMS calls alone. The volunteer’s role is to assist firefighters at the scene. There are no volunteer EMS stations in Taiwan.
  - damn, the one place where a person can actually volunteer in America, and not in Taiwan

HIGHER EDUCATION
Many universities and colleges in the United States provide EMS degrees for the public, but there is no university or college that provides an EMS degree in Taiwan. The only way for EMS providers to update EMS skills and knowledge is through additional training.

“Grats on SOLO school, as my instructors said, SOLO, WMI, and NOLS are the leaders in the industry in WEMT. Im sure the SOLO school was extremely good as well. “

“I chose WEMT because i spend a lot of time in the back country and overseas. i am.also hoping to do volunteer work with various NGO's and Natural Disaster relief.”

“Additionally, the program allowed me to complete my EMT including NREMT within less than a month! It was the perfect program for me -- my classmates were all very intelligent people, most were college grads and/or ex-military, including some folks who were taking time off prior to medical or PA school, which made for a great environment to learn in!”

The origin of SOLO, WMA, WMI/NOLS, etc can be traced to Frank Hubbard et al (SOLO) when they began offering a wilderness first aid course in the mid-70s. 

“he best wilderness medicine text currently on the market is "Wilderness Medicine", published by NOLS.”
