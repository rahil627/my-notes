from my search on GFF:
> First of all: This is my first time trying GFF. Just trying some CouchSurfing (CS) alternatives because now the CS community's economic values and expectations feel a bit high, increasing that awful feeling of forced tourism and/or gift-reciprocity (ex. language exchange), as opposed to, you know, just hanging out! Besides, this old school web format is totally awesome and efficient! :D

my comment on the allthatiswrong post
> Holy moly. I had similar feelings with CS too: it being good for a subset of young, narrow-minded, privileged, not entirely-open people (i.e. receptive to an American person who speaks English, and can cook and dance, as opposed to a rougher American farmer who might just want a warm shower [which is a now the title of hospitality exchange for bikers] and sleep after hitch-hiking ). I hear ya. LOL, at terming them “super-hippies”. Shouldn’t be negative though, they’re just people, with distorted perception of reality due to their experience and/or education, with a bit more desire than giving, resulting in less altruism.
note: I didn’t read the entire post or all of the comments, but I’m glad you etched this thought out long enough to provoke conversation. Good job. A whole 6 years ago!

  - way more in depth
  - under alternatives: “Some of these sites are more in line with my own views and philosophies than others, but none of them force any view on you and you can meet people of all types on each of the sites. I tend to prefer the people on GlobalFreeloaders as in my opinion they are more down to earth, but then I have had great experiences with Hospitality Club and appreciated people who were excited to share their culture without forcing it.”
  … “What is interesting about each of these sites is that their popularity differs by region. CouchSurfing is consistently popular everywhere, simply because people hear about it more often. GlobalFreeloaders seems slightly more popular or equal to CouchSurfing in many cities in Australia and the UK. When I was in Greece a few years ago, Hospitality Club was without a doubt the most popular. Looking at the BeWelcome countries list they seem to be most active in Western Europe, with France and Germany alone account for almost a third or their entire membership base. I think it would be interesting to try and work out if there is any reason for this or if it is just dumb luck.”
  - under the GFF review: “This really is the best of both worlds, as the people who prefer to mass mail the initial message are probably going to get on better with the people who don’t mind receiving a mass mailed message and wouldn’t get on with the people that need to feel extra special.”
