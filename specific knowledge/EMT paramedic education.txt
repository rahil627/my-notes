from a sticky note:
todo:
community college (CC) vs **WEMT (wilderness + standard EMT)
  - if there’s a WEMT near parent’s house, perfect!**
  - research state reprocity (able to use certification in another state)
    -> job in ambulance station
**try fire departments**
  - near parent’s home (Chesapeake, VA Beach, Suffolk, etc.)
  -> good pay in the US ($40,000 even during training phase!), but very few open spots. And, should read the conditions, might have to be expected to work for a year after training.

(also want to learn dive / snorkel during physical training as rescuer)
  -> Hawaii
    - Hawaii out-of-state education is crazy expensive

-> hitch / hop islands in the Pacific to NZ ->
can make $100,000 as a paramedic in Australia (and New Zealand!!!)
  -> hitch the world

Ireland?
Netherlands?
  - these two might have language problems

perhaps scholarships are reserved for nationals

Phillippines
  - cheap EMT and paramedic courses while getting raw experience?
