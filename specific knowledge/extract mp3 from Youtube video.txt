  - “64 aac+ works very well on minimal or ambient music, at least from my experience. I  was once suscribed to di.fm, and for these genre 64kps , I'd say "It doesn't matter”.”

Spotify premium and Apple Music seem to have high quality, but both costs money, thus making torrents the only solution for high quality music.
  - Spotify Premium is $10/month

  - 128, unless you bought an album, then it streams as v0 (VBR)

  - Actually SC [SoundCloud] streams music at 128 kbps and Spotify at a higher quality - 160 (free) / 320 (premium).

  - according to this thread in 2016, Youtube reduced audio quality to 128Kbps:
“Early 2016 to now (mid-2016) : 128kbps
mid-2013 - early 2016 : 256kbps
mid-2012 to mid-2013 : 192kbps
mid-2011 to mid-2012 : 152 kbps
prior to mid-2011 : 128 kbps”

# research and highlights
https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl
  - sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
    - might have to create /usr/local/bin folder
  - sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl

http://askubuntu.com/questions/178481/how-to-download-an-mp3-track-from-a-youtube-video
  - youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 <video URL>
  - might have to download ffmpeg
    - can put ffmpeg (and other command line tools [binaries]) in /usr/local/bin
  - Bear in mind as well that youtube-dl defaults to using avconv so you should consider specifying either avconv or FFmpeg at the commandline. From the online help:
  - —prefer-avconv                  Prefer avconv over ffmpeg for running the
                                 postprocessors (default)
  - —prefer-ffmpeg                  Prefer ffmpeg over avconv for running the
                                 postprocessors
    - from my experience, it prefers ffmpeg. But maybe because I don’t have avconv?

http://askubuntu.com/questions/634584/how-to-download-youtube-videos-as-a-best-quality-audio-mp3-using-youtube-dl
  - youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3  --audio-quality  0  <Video-URL>
  - So in simple the option --audio-quality  0 is same as using bestaudio, you don't need to use bestaudio.
  - Using bestaudio will obligate to download m4a, so you have to convert it back to mp3.
