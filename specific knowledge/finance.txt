"pick the issuer, then the best card, to get the best deal"

credit union vs bank
Since credit unions return profits to their members, interest rates for savings and checking accounts at credit unions tend to be higher than at commercial banks, while fees and minimums tend to be lower. But a credit union may offer fewer services than a bank and they may have more restricted access to ATMs.

best card issuers / customer service
USAA?
U.S. Bank?
1) Discover
2) American Express
schwab?
penfed?
3) CitiBank & Chase
others (capital one, bank of america)

best website
discover
american express
CitiBank & Chase
capital one
bank of america

notable cards
1) penfed has the best cash back card, but is tough to get, and wouldn't have the best website....not that i'll be using it much
schwab has 2% cash back, but aren't registering people at the moment
costco amex
american express blue cash
discover - awesome rewards, website, and reviews, but limited access
capital one has bad reviews, but no foriegn transaction fee, and an okay card

http://creditshout.com/cash-back-credit-card-calculator/

use credit card for internet purchases and debit card for everything else

charge cards:
has an annual fee - $25 for the lowest, but others are $125+!
only american express offer these?

credit card vs debit card
main difference: debit comes from your bank, credit is money you owe to the bank who paid the vendors
with a credit card, you can battle errors quicker?
both have overdraft fees
debit cards don't require a PIN or photo ID, so it's easier to steal
credit cards have strict liability laws, they will investigate fraudulent charges if you request it within 60 days
for debit cards, your liablity is $50 within the first two days, then $500 for 60 days, then your entire bank account!
credit cards effect credit ratings, which include automobile loans, mortgages and personal loans.

so...as long as you check your debit card every two days for theft, you're safe! or you could just keep a small amount of money in that bank account, and replenish as needed...

reward is only 1-2%


cash back vs travel vs rewards vs other?

features i want:
no over limit fee

cash back
capital one no hassle cash rewards - 2% on gas/groceries, 1% on the rest
chase freedom 
american express blue cash - 5% on gas/grocery/medicine, 1% on rest
discover open road - 2% on restaurants and gas, 1% on the rest
ink cash business card - 3% cash back at gas stations, restaurants, office supply and home improvement stores, 1% on the rest
true earnings card from costco and american express - 3% on gas/restaurants, 2% for travel, 1% on the rest
*discover more (and some other one) - have to sign up for each 5% category, custom, $15/$39 over limit fee, $0 Fraud Liability Guarantee (not responsible for fraudulent charges), high APR

travel
capital one no hassle miles (ultra for pro) - 1 mile/dollar, 2 miles per dollar above $1000, no limit on mile earnings, redeem for travel/merchandise/gift cards, fly free on any airline to any destitaion, no blackout date or seat restrictions, no foreign transaction fee
blue sky american express - 1 mile/dollar, points good on any airline/hotel/car rental/more
miles (escape is pro) by discover - 1 mile/dollar, 2 miles/dollar on travel and restaurants, flexible redemption options of travel/gift cards/cash, 12,000 bonus miles

reward
chase sapphire



how does it check grocery? does walmart count?

.01*6000 = 60 min cash back
.05*6000 = 300 max cash back


140/33500 = 0.004 - rewards suck

based on capital one no hassle
15,000 miles = $150
35,000 miles = $150-$350
60,000 miles = $350-600

so at max, 75 cash back (but can only be used for travel!)

cash back cards are the best deal

discover more...so far

bad cards - anything by one company--delta, exxon, etc.

how large is discover's market share? may be better to keep visa.
it's also convenient to use my bank's credit card, to make payments immediately.

my bank's card (wachovia) vs discover more
i'll stick with wachovia. it's convenient, and i'm lazy.
may be worth changing when i use more than 6000/year.
