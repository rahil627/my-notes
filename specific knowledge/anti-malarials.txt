conclusion:
For long-term, the intake any anti-malaria will likely display side effects. Taking none and avoiding mosquito bites seems like the best option. Even Jon said no long-term traveler in Kenya took an anti-malarial; It's not worth the side effects or money. He also feels that it is overblown by overly cautious Westerners and possibly the drug companies.

For short-term, Atovaquone / Proguanil is best. Can use Cholorquine in areas where mosquitos are not resistant to it.

is it okay to change medicine?

Chloroquine:
Cheap. Low side effects, and family uses it without problems. Resisted in many areas.

Atovaquone/Proguanil (Malarone, Malanil):
Expensive ($4/daily pill). Low side effects. Difficult to find in non-industrialized countries.

Start only two days before entering area, and continue taking 7 days after area.

Doxycycline:
Cheap. Tetracyclines are a general antibiotic which works against several diseases. Might be causing me digestion problems. Do not take if have achilles tendon.

Start two days before, end 28 days after. Causes photo-sensitivity — use sunscreen, wait 20 minutes, then use mosquito spray.

It is the only anti-biotic that is an anti-malarial. Try to take it at a time different from other medicines and supplement (vitamins)*. Antacids are known to interfere with doxycycline absorption*. Take it with a meal, otherwise nausea is likely and unpleasant. Do not lie down for the hour after taking it, or else it may dissolve in the esophagus! Combined with pain medications and NSAIDs (ibuprofen) may cause stomach distress. In general Doxycycline side effects can be unpredictable, even caffeine, alcohol, and certain foods may cause distress.

Chloroquine:
Not effective as certain parasites are resistant to it according to the Center of Disease Control of the U.S. and a local Indian doctor I asked.

Mefloquine:
Kinda scary to me, as it has psychological and neurological side effects. The local doctor prescribed me this, but I'll likely cancel it.

notes from Williamsburg Clinic:
Try to  take around same time each day with plenty of water and a full meal (especially Doxycycline!). In addition, should use 25-35% deet spray.

Avoid taking anti-motility unless it’s severe, but if you do, always take antibiotic dose first, then ammonium two hours after.
