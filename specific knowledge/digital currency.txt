# wallets

https://www.cryptocompare.com/wallets/#/overview

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWallet/comments/1yzkoh/coinbase_vs_blockchain/
  - “In terms of security, I'd suggest:
Online wallets that hold all the private keys (Coinbase) < Online wallets where only the client (theoretically) has the private keys < Desktop wallet on an online Windows PC < Desktop wallet on a Mac or Linux PC < Desktop wallet on a LiveCD on an otherwise online PC < (Desktop wallet on a permanently offline PC OR Paper wallets)”

https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets
  - good list by OS
  - **Breadwallet seems like a winner for iOS**

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2xgtqp/best_overall_wallet_for_mac_osx/
  - mobile wallets more secure by default
    - “Agreed. Mobile wallets like Breadwallet and Mycelium are the best fit for 90% of people”
  - paper wallets!
  - Electrum, Hive, Ninki
  - Multibit

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1118123.0;all
  - Mycelium , Circle, wallet32

conclusion:
1. Breadwallet (or other iOS/mobile wallet)
2. multiple “paper wallets”

temp for OS X:
Electrum
  - 2FA via TrustedCoin has a $1.50 fee
    - https://api.trustedcoin.com/#/electrum-help
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31rf0v/is_an_electrum_standard_wallet_enough_protection/
    - “Is the system you run Electrum on secure? It alls depends if that system is clean or it might have malware.”
    - “Enough for what? You haven't given enough info. The amount of effort you put into securing your coins should be proportional to the amount of coins you have (in that wallet). You don't have bank grade security on your wallet in your pocket do you?”

  - “What is the minimum quantity of transfer bitcoin via BitoEX?

The fees of transfering bitcoin in BitoEX is 0.0001 bitcoin ($0.40). The minimum quantity of transfering is 0.001 bitcoin.”
  - “First, you need to sign in BitoEX. You can set up withdraw amount and bank account from the My Wallet menu under the Withdrawal tab. If your cash balance is less than minimum withdrawal amount, you can use the Sell Bitcoin functionality, which is from the Sell Bitcoin menu under the Sell Bitcoin tab, to sell your bitcoin. After you selling your bitcoin, the cash amount will add to your account cash balance.”
  - “How long does it take to withdraw money from BitoEX?

If the cumulative amount per day is less than 100,000, it takes 2-5 work days to transfer money to your bank account. Otherwise, it takes about 10 work days.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i5mvo/how_is_bitcoin_that_anonymous_if_i_have_to_verify/
  - “Bitcoin is anonymous. The exchanges are not. That's the government rub.
Now if you walk up to me and say, "Hey, I'd like to buy some bitcons from you", create your own address and I send them to you for cash then you can't get much more anonymous than that.”
  - “This annoying verification crap is what the government forces the exchanges to do, otherwise they get screwed for not complying with anti-money-laundering regulation. You're correct to be angry about it, because it's bullshit. But it is as it is. If you want more anonymous coins, you have 3 alternatives:
buy them from someone you meet in person (localbitcoins), or via something like bitcoin-otc - always be careful and apply common sense though. There are scammers everywhere.
use a mixing service like blockchain.info's shared send to launder your coins after you buy them at an exchange
mine them yourselves. It doesn't get more anonymous than that, but it's hardly an option if you just want to buy some coins.”

  - “I suggest picking a wallet from https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet considering only those wallets without mouse-over warning.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6cgo8i/wtf_coinbase_new_higher_fees/
  - “Coinbase is a service that is heavily legitimizing Bitcoin. They will have high fees and they will have strict security and identity checks.
They are absolutely the EASIEST way to get new people in to crypto. They are doing a ton for this community and I think it's kind of entitled to complain considering the risk they are taking.
If you are an advanced Bitcoin user there are many many exchanges you can use with low fees or, like many people mentioned, you can even use Coinbase's own exchange GDAX for low fees.
Coinbase's main frontend has easy to use apps, easy to purchase methods, great security, insurance, etc etc. There's a ton of reasons these fees exist especially right now during extremely high bandwidth and turmoil in the technology. They are completely shielding average users from this and make it so simple nearly anyone can get in to it.
Before Coinbase I had basically zero way to get my non-tech friends in to Bitcoin. For my tech friends, I tell them to use one of DOZENS of exchanges where fees are lower if they are trading with any frequency.”
    - “Coinbase is no so simpler for beginners than Gemini. And Gemini has lower fees than Coinbase.
Thanks coinbase, for what you've done for Bitcoin. You still have to compete for my business.”
    - try Gemini?
  - “I just sent 2.40 cents from my Coinbase account to a new Blockchain wallet as a test and received 0.24 cents in the wallet. Coinbase fee appears to be 90% of the transaction. Actual data, I sent .000979 bitcoin and received .0001 bitcoin!
I have been a Coinbase supporter for years but this seems a bit outrageous. I guess we will never be able to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin.”
