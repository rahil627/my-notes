disciplines:
Parkour
Qinggong
Muay Thai

experience:
P90X
  - good variety for a tone body
Insanity
  - fast pace
  - pushes body, if you need a break, take a few second off, then continue
  - i like the quick routine: cardio warm-up -> stretch -> workout -> cool down. The warm-up, stretch, and cool-down are all very quick.

just stretch out any way you feel! Focus on places where it pains or cracks. Be weird about it!*****
