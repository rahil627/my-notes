Disk diagnostic and CHKDSK /R are common to all in order to rule out:
- physical disk problems and
- file system problems PRIOR to trying the fix.

Common to several fixes
Black Screen Hang (before splash screen shows)
- Disk Diagnostic
- CHKDSK /R (try to boot) [/R implies /P in recovery console] [/R implies /F in windows]
- fixmbr (try to boot)
- fixboot (try to boot)
- Safe Mode (try to boot)

- Disk Diagnostic
- CHKDSK /F /R

more than one boot entry
The problematic Boot.ini file needs to be edited to ensure correct Default entry and accurate pointing to directories. For this go to My Computer->Properties->Advanced->Settings (under Startup and Recovery)-> System Setup->Edit. You can also use bootcfg /rebuild command through Recovery Console command prompt

writing zeros to a drive:
When you do the write zero test, it basically will write from the first to the last sector of the harddisk and in doing so can determine if any of the sector is bad and remap it. 
If however your harddisk's bad sector is growing and it is not due to a virus then you might want to look at getting a harddisk replacement and copy as much data as possible over to the new harddisk.


sfc /scannow - http://www.updatexp.com/scannow-sfc.html


errors => solution
-unmountable boot disk blue screen => chkdsk from windows recovery
-"the volume appears to contain one or more unrecoverable problems" -> chkdsk => write zeros to drive. the hard drive was too old and died soon after
x2-spyware => hiren's boot cd -> run all anti-spyware and anti-virus programs. then, boot into safe mode and rename and run combo fix
-hard drive would not should up in BIOS, had a power surge earlier => replug the cable to the hard drive
